Thanks for dropping by.

There is a <a href="https://github.com/brunosan/brunosan.eu/issues"  target="_parent">list of Issues</a> IÂ´m already aware.

Please <a href="https://github.com/brunosan/brunosan.eu/issues/new" target="_parent"> add yours</a> if something is broken on the site.

Each post has also a *Send edit request* button which makes it easy to send me a Github Pull request. And <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2012/07/01/jekyll-pull-requests/" target="_parent" > this is what it means </a>.
