Thanks for dropping by.

Please <a href="https://github.com/brunosan/brunosan.eu/issues/new" target="_parent"> let me know</a> if something is broken on the site. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/brunosan/brunosan.eu/issues"  target="_parent">list of Issues</a> IÂ´m already aware of.

Each post has also a **Send edit request** button which makes it easy to send me a "Github Pull request". And <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2012/07/01/jekyll-pull-requests/" target="_parent" > this is what that means </a>.
