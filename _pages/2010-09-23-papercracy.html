title: Papercracy
---
This is an idea for a <a href="www.papercracy.info">webpage</a> I had for a while.It will be a metrics system to for scientific research. It will allow measure research integrity, ranking, publication output, citation behavior, ...
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/papercracy-001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-998 aligncenter" title="papercracy.001" src="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/papercracy-001.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
The main part is the parser, it would process papers adding information to the database: Authors, Citations, Papers, Bibliography and Abstract (if not copyrighted)

With that information there is a ton of things one could do. Production timelines, self citation metrics, reciprocal citations, … I have many many ideas, but first I need the database and parser.

I will start with my field (astrophysics) as I more familiar with it and seems quite easy (NASA has a complete database that produces XML output).
The <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html">NASA database</a> can return <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2010SoPh..261...53V&amp;data_type=XML">XML format</a> ready for parsing. This is, for example, the return for <a href="http://goo.gl/8Ve4">myself</a>

The funny thing is that it includes links to the paper pages, so with just few searches you can start filling a queue of queries and parsing the whole thing and adding info to the DBs.

These are the databases

AUTHOR DB
Name: Name of person. String
Aliases: Posible Aliases. String Array
URL: ADS webpage. String
P_URL: Personal URL. String
email: emails. String array
UniqueId: Integer
Papers IDs: Integer array (order not important)
Picture: Picture. Image

PAPER DB
Title: Full Title. String
URL: URL for online paper. String
URL_free: URL for online free access paper. String
Publisher: Peer review journal code. String
UniqueID: BIBcode
Authors: AUTHOR DB UniqueID in order of appearance. Integer Array
Date: Date of publication. Integer
Date_sub: Submitted date. Integer
Bibliography: PAPER UniqueID. Integer Array
Abstract: Text. Text
Keywords: Keyword. String Array

Possible outputs
1-Show a timeline with a line when paper is published. Bar Length is (author_position / number of authors).
2-Show a timeline of citations, divided by number of co-authors.
3-Calculate stander indexes.
4-Create static webpages for each Author, with ranked collaborator.
5-Anything you think could help
