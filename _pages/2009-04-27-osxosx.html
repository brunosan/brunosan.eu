<!--:en-->[I kept this page unmodified since 2006, but as soon as I removed it, a couple of friends complained.... So, here it is, back online and mostly updated. Comments welcomed ]

 

<hr />Lately few of friends are switching to Apple, and since I have been user of this platform for some years already, I am now and then asked for help or support.

I have decided to create this page, which essentially is a compilation of hints seen around the Internet. I hope this will help the people work better on their machines.

I do not provide here official support or workarounds, and all the information presented here just worked in my case. You are aware that everything you decide to do with your machine, legal or otherwise, is up to your entire responsibility. If it seems that I do endorse you to do anything on your mac, it is NOT the case.

If you are new to Mac, Welcome, you won't regret it. At least, I don´t.

If I were to take a  new Mac  these are the things I would do to start feeling at home:
<ul>
	<li>Install <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Quick Silver</a>.
Hit the combo key, type the initials of whatever program you want to use, type the folder and drag a document to the icon, send mails, find a contact, .... It even has a clipboard history (like Klipper on KDE)</li>
	<li>Install <a href="http://perian.org/">Perian</a>
Perian is a free, open source QuickTime component that adds native support for many popular video formats.</li>
	<li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=915D874D-D747-4180-A400-5F06B1B5E559&amp;displaylang=en">Flip4Mac</a>
If you want to see WMV.</li>
	<li>If on a laptop, install<a href="http://www.lobotomo.com/products/FanControl/"> Fan control</a> control panel
To reduce the fan speed of the laptop when idle.</li>
	<li>Install Processor control panel
To deactivate one of the cores for whatever reason, like saving battery life. It is already on your system, under /Developer/Extras/PreferencePanes/ (you need to install the Developer option on OSX)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.grabup.com/index.php">Grab up</a> is a very fast way to sharing screenshots over Internet. Press the keystroke, select region and just paste the link to the on-the-fly created and uploaded picture.</li>
	<li>Install <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">Mac Geeck</a>
It is nice  to put info on the background. Quite handy. In my case I have a black background and I see the system log, Top processes by CPU and MEM usage and network transfer speed. More later.</li>
	<li>Install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-secrets/wiki/Help">Secrets</a>
Tons of options to modify settings.</li>
	<li>Enable root account.
I don´t actually remember how to enable it anymore...</li>
	<li>Install Developers tools, darwin ports, X-11, Latex, IDL, LatexIt, vim, ...
but that's probably not for everyone.</li>
</ul>
Besides these things I would really miss these <strong>Applications</strong>, Google the name to get more info of search for it on iusethis:
<ul>
	<li>Adeona, takes location info randomly and sends it so that you could trace the laptop if it gets stolen</li>
	<li>Adium, the messenger of Mac. But I don´t use it so much anymore.</li>
	<li>BibDesk. To handle the Bibliografy on LaTeX.</li>
	<li>ClamXav. A free antiirus for Mac. Not that there are viruses for Mac, but is good the check what you forward to your PC contacts.</li>
	<li>Eavesdrop. To sniff the Internet traffic that goes through your ethernet.</li>
	<li>FileZilla. A free and good FTP manager.</li>
	<li>Firefox. For those pages that doesn´t work on Safari.</li>
	<li>LateXiT. To put all kind of LaTeX equation on presentations. Creates a drag&amp;drop tranparent PDF. A must for scientist.</li>
	<li>MassReplaceit. It actually is on the Developer folder. Replaces strings on multiple folders at once.</li>
	<li>NetNewsWire. To read the RSS feeds.</li>
	<li>SeisMac. A funny program that reads the acelerometer. Interesting while on turbulences on a flight :)</li>
	<li>Sim Daltonism. If you ever wodered how a daltonic sees your viewgraphs.</li>
	<li>Skim. A PDF reader that allows to add markup and "watch" files for changes.</li>
	<li>SubEthaEdit or Smultron. Text editors, to create code.</li>
	<li>TexShop. To write in Latex.</li>
	<li>Tunatic. Play a song and it tells you the title.</li>
	<li>Vine Server. VNC server.</li>
</ul>
For Linux-style users:

Install X11 from the installation disk, it is under Optional installs.

Install the Developers kit, also using the installation disks, you might not need some of the things, like the Documentation)

Install <strong>darwin ports</strong> from the Internet, just google Darwin ports to get the webpage. It is similar to apt-get in Debian, just name what program you want and it will get it for you, compile it and install it.

 

Also, a bunch of advices or things I just use when working on my mac.
<ul>
	<li>Try to remember keystrokes, it will speed up a lot the things, most of the apps are consistent with general guidelines.</li>
	<li>You can press F9 to show dashboard, but you can change the button, or even press command when clicking which button you want to use, so you won´t get expose unless you press that button.</li>
	<li>You can drag and drop things using expose. Indeed you can navigate the entire disk while holding a file with the mouse, just wait a second on top of a folder and it ill open. Press alternative to move/copy.</li>
	<li>Remember you can create links to files or folders pressing command+alternative. or dragging it to the side bar of the finder. I discovered it is really fast to place any folder there to use it even once when moving things around.</li>
	<li>Press shift when minimizing a window and it will squeeze down slowly. Not very useful though.</li>
	<li>I almost never turn off my laptop, just close the lid, and leave it like that. I think It can last for a month, and when is almost completely empty, it stores the RAM into disk, so next time it just recovers (hard sleep mode, I think is called).</li>
	<li>Turn off the laptop holding the menu button of the remote for a couple of seconds</li>
	<li>Drop any text to Safary´s icon at the dock will create a new window with the google search of that text. Drop any icon into Terminal and it will write the full path to the dragged icon.</li>
	<li>Images in a Mail can be resized with the handy bar at the bottom of the compose window. It shows also the total size of the draft.</li>
	<li>when typing a complicated word just press esc and it will show the possible known words (in cocoa apps).</li>
	<li>press command+control+d and move the moves over a word, you´ll get the definition. Useful for not English native speakers.</li>
	<li>Press command when clicking the name of a file in a program window  (like Text editors, Quick Time, ...) and it will show you the hard disk path to the file, press any folder to go there.</li>
	<li>Press command when moving a background windows to move it without taking to the front.</li>
	<li>Remember that alternative+command+H will hide all app running but the one in the front.</li>
	<li>Spotlight is there for you, remember you can find anything in second. There are plugins that will allow to index the content of more files, like inside .zip files or also index all text files (like .pros)</li>
	<li>Trust the system, really. It is NOT windows. if it gets frozen, wait 10 seconds, it will probably recover. If not, press control+alternative+esc and wait 5 seconds. A window will tell you which program is not responding. if it doesn´t work, if you can, and know how to, access the system trough ssh from the network and kill the process which is collapsing the system.</li>
	<li>Don't hesitate, just do whatever you guess it could work, most probably it will work.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:small;"><strong> Apps, apps and more apps</strong></span>

The first and I guess biggest thing a <em>switcher</em> has to deal with is the apple concept of application (program), <strong>installations</strong> and so.
First of all, forget about installations.... most of the time.
If you get a program and the icon is like a box, has the extension of .pkg or is named installation... yes you have to install it, so just double click and you are done, like in windows. Most of the time it means that the program has to touch few things in many places so there is a script that makes all, like in windows....

Nevertheless 90% programs will be come just  in a .dmg file that, when clicked, will mount a disk that will pop up just showing the icon of the application. It is indeed a folder and if you want to take a look just make right click (control-click) and select "show package content". To install it all you need to do is drag it and drop it on your application folder, just on the left of every finder window or navigate to it. Indeed you have 2 application folder, one is system wide and the other is seen only by the user. Normally just install everything on the system wide. (system-wide /Applications or  User-wide ~/Applications).
The first time the app is launched (clicked) it will see that it has no users files so it will create them. These files are located in every users "Library" folder , usually under "Application support" or "Preferences". Again there is also a system wide Libary and application support.
If need to <strong>re-install</strong> a program, just locate the preferences folder and delete it. They usually have the same name as the app. Within each of them, usually there is a .plist file with your preferences on window size and so. Change it, and if you screw it up, delete it, it will like re-install in Windows.

To <strong>un-install</strong> a app just take it to the Trash, that easy. Well, If you want to delete the preferences you'll have to go to yor Library folder. Sometimes there is also a script to automate things. There are also programs which will help you wih that, like AppZapper, drag any app icon to this program and it will tell you where are all the files associated with it. The free version of AppZapper is called AppDelete.

Be aware that certain programs like Darwin ports or others are much more difficult to uninstall, so in those cases just make a bit of googleing.

If it happens that you throw an important app, like Terminal, to the trash and then empty the Trash... don´t panic and go to somebody else Mac (or your Time Machine backup).... Just copy it over. It will likely work. I did once deleted the whole Utilities folder and then emptied the Trash... Anyway, when you try to delete a lot of things or delicate ones, OSX will likely ask you for your password.

<strong>Z buffer and IDL</strong>

This is the code I use to create a PNG true color file. Duping the screen content with tvrd() doesn´t help if the size of the data is bigger than the screen, so I use the feared Z bufferÑ
<div>ssize=size(a)</div>
<div>set_plot,'z' ;set the z buffer</div>
<div>device,SET_PIXEL_DEPTH=24, $</div>
<div>SET_RESOLUTION= [ssize[1], ssize[2]], $</div>
<div>SET_CHARACTER_SIZE = [16, 20], decomposed=0 ;set the options for the device</div>
<div>plot_image,a,scale=[0.115,0.115],xtitle='arcsec',ytitle='arcsec' ;this is a Solar Soft routine</div>
<div>tvlct,rr,gg,bb,/get ;get the color tables</div>
<div>write_png,'fullfov/'+'composite.png',tvrd(/true),rr,gg,bb ;write a png dump of the content of the zbuffer, with the true colors</div>
<div>...and then make a high def movie with:</div>
