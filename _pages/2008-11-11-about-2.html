<h6 style="text-align:right;"><span style="font-weight:normal;"><em>"Life is a succession of convergent moments.
There is no destiny, is just our way, with our inertia.
Learn to recognize the moments,
enjoy them, take the best of each of them,
and never loose the overall picture.</em></span>"</h6>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The main reason for this site is to provide a direct link to reach me. I am interested in "<strong>Science and Technology for Society</strong>", specially the use of new technologies to empower society, development, sustainability or crisis response. Content of this site also serve to support and share my current and past professional activities (like my PhD thesis or science outreach material). I also try to provide content that could be of interest (like book reviews). All this content is mostly professional about Science and Technology. More personal content goes to <a href="http://twitter.com/brunosan">Twitter</a>,  or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/brunosan">Facebook</a>.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I consider myself a inquisitive open-minded person, advocating for a better world where Science, Technology and Society get to understand better each other. We live amazing times, where we are exposed to much more information, where we can reach much further and where making change is easier than ever. Huge chances for a better world are possible... Parallely,  chances for the worse are also possible. Technology makes us lazy, procrastinators and dependent. I see both Science and Technology as tools. Tools for welfare, tools for leverage, tools for a better tomorrow. It´s up to <strong>us</strong>. Now, more than ever, we (all of us) are responsible for the future, and our actions are indeed votes for the world we want to live in. Dare not to join?</p>
