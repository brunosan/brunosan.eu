<h1>Installing and using FFmpeg on Mac OS X</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg project</a> is a fast, accurate multimedia transcoder
which can be applied in a variety of scenarios on OS X.</p>

<p>If you just want to add a good video transcoder to a toolset that
already includes Final Cut Pro, Adobe Photoshop, and similar tools,
<a href="https://homepage.mac.com/major4/">FFmpegX</a> may be your best choice because of its familiar
Mac-style user interface.</p>

<p>But it's possible that you are interested in using FFmpeg to set up an
automated, web based system to transcode a variety of input video
formats to the Flash video format, which can easily be displayed on
the web.</p>

<p>In this case it will be necessary to approach FFmpeg on its own terms
as a command-line, Linux-centric project.  You will need to learn the
installation techniques commonly used by open source projects, and the
starting point for your work will be running Terminal and working
mostly from the command line.  This article will apply these
techniques in a step-by-step manner to installing a version of FFmpeg
which has most of the features you will need.  Some techniques will be
used without explanation, so be prepared to do some Googling to fill
in the gaps in your knowledge.</p>

<p>Before you can follow these instructions, you must install Apple's
Developer Tools.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites: LAME</h2>

<p>MP3 is the audio codec most often used with Flash video, so you will
need an MP3 encoder.  FFmpeg doesn't include one, but it will use
<a href="https://lame.sourceforge.net/">LAME</a>, which creates good quality audio files, if you
install it.  Header files will be needed during the compile, so it is
not enough to install a prebuilt binary using a package manager.
Instead follow these directions to compile it from source:</p>

<p>Start by creating a working directory:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/lame
cd ~/lame
</code></pre>

<p>On a good day you can get the latest source code release of LAME <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=290">from
Sourceforge</a>.  The file you want will be named
lame-3.97.tar.gz or something similar.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, do what I did and get the bleeding edge release
from revision control:</p>

<pre><code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame \
  login
cvs -z3 \
  -d:pserver:anonymous@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame \
  co -P lame
</code></pre>

<p>If you download the tar file, you need to unpack it as follows (this
command is not necessary if you used CVS):</p>

<pre><code>tar xvzf lame-3.97.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>After downloading and unpacking the source or checking it out from
CVS, change to the main directory and then enter the three commands
which are typically used to build open source projects:</p>

<pre><code>cd lame-3.97
./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Each command will take a minute or so to complete.  You should keep an
eye out for any errors which may occur, but installing LAME is
generally trouble-free.</p>

<h2>Optional: FAAC and FAAD</h2>

<p>Since Quicktime commonly uses AAC for audio, you may want to encode
and decode that format.  Here again FFmpeg doesn't include built-in
codecs, but it will use the codecs provided by <a href="https://audiocoding.com/">another open source
project</a> if you install them first.</p>

<p>Installing these codecs used to be so difficult that I wouldn't even
have tried to address it in an introductory article, but recent
improvements mean that you can simply download the <a href="https://www.audiocoding.com/downloads.html">latest
releases</a> and follow the instructions they provide, for example:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/faad
cd ~/faad
curl -O https://downloads.sourceforge.net/faac/faad2-2.6.1.tar.gz
tar xvzf faad2-2.6.1.tar.gz
cd faad2
less INSTALL
# (follow the instructions you see there)
</code></pre>

<p>It's generally a good idea to poke around in the main directory for
files named INSTALL and README and pay attention to the instructions
there.  Often that's all you need.</p>

<h2>Building FFmpeg for Mac OS X Leopard</h2>

<p>Recent versions of FFmpeg will compile successfully on versions of OS
X as far back as 10.3.  Before that OS X used an older version of the
C compiler which is no longer compatible with FFmpeg.  It's possible
to get an older version of FFmpeg running on OS X 10.2 (read on), but
you may not be satisfied with its capabilities.</p>

<p>If you have a choice it's best to run a recent version of FFmpeg,
which means downloading the source code from one of the revision
control systems used by the developers, or getting a nightly
snapshot.  Using revision control for something this simple is pretty
easy, and it's a useful technique, so that's what we'll do.  Recent
versions of Xcode already include Subversion (a newish revision
control tool which really isn't so bad), so we'll use that.</p>

<p>First create a working directory:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/ffmpeg
cd ~/ffmpeg
</code></pre>

<p>The up-to-date version of FFmpeg generally compiles cleanly, and that
is the version you usually will want:</p>

<pre><code>svn checkout svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg
cd ffmpeg
</code></pre>

<p>Next, configure and make</p>

<pre><code>./configure --enable-libmp3lame --enable-shared \
  --disable-mmx --arch=x86_64
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>The --disable-mmx flag is not required on a PowerPC.  If you leave it
out on an Intel Mac, you will probably get a compile error, but it's
worth trying since it will provide a speed boost.  If you installed
the AAC codecs, add the flags --enable-libfaac and --enable-libfaad.</p>

<p>(According to a <a href="https://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.user/23143">discussion on ffmpeg-user</a> The "--arch" flag is
required under Snow Leopard.  Experiment.)</p>

<h3>A fallback</h3>

<p>When I tested for this article originally, the latest source in the
Subversion repository did not compile cleanly.  My workaround was to
use a known stable revision.  In general, FFmpeg is a moving target
and you may encounter new issues that I did not.  See the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/mailinglists.html">mailing
lists</a> for the latest information.  Here's how to build FFmpeg
if you have problems with the latest release</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/ffmpeg
svn checkout --revision 15624 \
  svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg-15624
cd ffmpeg-15624
./configure --enable-libmp3lame --enable-shared --disable-mmx
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, the --disable-mmx flag is not required on a PowerPC-based
Mac.  There is nothing special about revision 15624, it's just a
version that happened to compile when this article was revised.  If
FFmpeg is not compiling on OS X because of a recent change,
subtracting a small amount from the latest revision number will
probably fix the issue.  Work your way backwards until you find
something that works.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you've installed FFmpeg.  The next section describes
a similar procedure for OS X 10.2, so skip ahead for additional
information on running FFmpeg.</p>

<h2>Building FFmpeg for Mac OS X 10.2</h2>

<p>[<em>Update:</em> the OS X 10.2 procedure results in an ffmpeg binary that
can decode only some of the video formats listed in the ffmpeg
documentation.  In particular, it can't decode Quicktime video.  Take
this into account before you go to the trouble of downloading and
compiling it.  On the other hand, this is one of the few free
alternatives to Macromedia Flash for converting mpeg into Flash video,
and you may be able to convert Quicktime to mpeg by other means.]</p>

<p>Start by creating a build directory:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/ffmpeg
cd ~/ffmpeg
</code></pre>

<p>Compiling on OS X 10.2 requires a patch, and it makes sense to patch
against a known release.  So we will download a recent release, which
can be found by clicking <a href="https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1.tar.gz?download">here</a>, and unpack it:</p>

<pre><code>tar xvzf ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>I have modified a patch by <a href="https://www.christophseibert.de/weblog/en/it/computer-vision/tools/opencv-mac.html">Christoph Seibert</a> to compile on
Mac OS X 10.2 (if it doesn't work on another version of OS X, try
Christoph's patch).  Download it by right-clicking <a href="ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1-macosx-10-2.patch.gz">here</a> and
uncompress it:</p>

<pre><code>gzip -d ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1-macosx-10-2.patch.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Change to the ffmpeg source directory and apply the patch:</p>

<pre><code>cd ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1
patch -p1 &lt; ../ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1-macosx-10-2.patch
</code></pre>

<p>(For more information on using patch, see <a href="diff-patch-ten-minutes.html">my article on diff and
patch</a>.)</p>

<p>Now build the project:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --enable-mp3lame --enable-shared --enable-pthreads \
  --disable-vhook
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h2>Some flv examples</h2>

<p>FFmpeg is now installed.  There are instructions in the doc/
directory, but basic commands are quite simple, and you will find that
they are similar to ImageMagick, if you have used it.  To convert an
mpeg video to Flash, use:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i video.mpg -ar 22050 video.flv
</code></pre>

<p>(The "-ar 22050" flag sets an audio sample rate of 22050 Hz.  It is
usually necessary to set a sample rate when encoding flv files because
the MP3 encoder only supports rates of 11025, 22050, and 44100 Hz.)
That's the basic idea, but in practical uses you will probably want to
take control over more of the quality settings.  A more realistic
command would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i video.mov -b 600k -r 24 -ar 22050 -ab 96k video.flv
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"-b 600k" selects a video bitrate of 600 kilobits per second.  This
is a compromise between quality and bandwidth (with older versions
of FFmpeg you would use "-b 600".  Type "ffmpeg -h" to check which
units are expected in your version);</p></li>
<li><p>"-r 24" selects 24 video frames per second;</p></li>
<li><p>"-ar 22050" selects an audio sample rate of 22050 Hz, which is
sufficient for voice;</p></li>
<li><p>"-ab 96k" selects an audio bit rate of 96 kilobits per second; you
could go a little lower for voice-only audio (with older versions of
FFmpeg you would use "-ab 96".  Type "ffmpeg -h" to check.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the parameters you will adjust most often.  Finding the
perfect values for your material is a matter of experiment.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>flv 1.1 metadata</h3>

<p>FFmpeg is a moving target, and this issue is resolved in the latest
version of FFmpeg from the Subversion repository.  In older versions,
however, FFmpeg didn't write the FLV metadata which is required for
the scrubber bar to work in some Flash video players.</p>

<p>If you experience this problem, there is a fix:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, try upgrading to the latest version of FFmpeg.</p></li>
<li><p>If for some reason you can't upgrade, get the <a href="https://www.buraks.com/flvmdi/">FLV Metadata
Injector</a> (Windows-only), or <a href="https://www.inlet-media.de/flvtool2">FLVTool2</a> (OS X and
Linux) and process your flv files with them.  See the links for
instructions.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>make build errors</h3>

<p>According to the mailing list, FFmpeg is sensitive to the version of
"make" you are running and the build will fail in many cases.  Recent
testing shows that the current stable version of GNU make (3.81) will
work, but 3.79 and 3.80 will both fail, for different reasons.  BSD
make (also distributed with OS X as "bsdmake") will fail with multiple
errors.  If you are having a problem with make, the simple solution
would be to upgrade Developer Tools.</p>

<h3>Alternate download methods</h3>

<p>If your version of Xcode doesn't include a Subversion client, refer to
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html">the FFmpeg download page</a> and pick another method to get
the source, for example:</p>

<pre><code>curl -O https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-export-snapshot.tar.bz2
tar xvjf ffmpeg-export-snapshot.tar.bz2
</code></pre>

<h3>Runtime errors</h3>

<p>Some FFmpeg error messages are a little cryptic.  Here are a few I
have encountered:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you try to decode a video format that FFmpeg does not
understand, you get the message</p>

<pre><code>No audio or video streams available
</code></pre>

<p>Just try again with another format, or recompile FFmpeg to add the
codec you need.</p></li>
<li><p>If you build FFmpeg without the --enable-libmp3lame flag and try to
encode to Flash video, the audio stream will be silently discarded.
Only by encoding to another format that does not require MP3 will you
discover that this is not the expected behavior.  In this case just
follow the instructions in this article to install LAME, if necessary,
and recompile FFmpeg with LAME support.</p></li>
<li><p>When encoding to MP3, you may receive the message</p>

<pre><code>Could not write header for output file #0 (incorrect codec
parameters ?)
</code></pre>

<p>In practice, this means that you should use the -ar flag to set an
audio sample rate of 11025, 22050, or 44100 Hz.</p></li>
</ol>
