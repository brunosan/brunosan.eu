<h3 id="firstbrainstormingsession">First Brainstorming Session</h3>

<p>Washington, D.C.<br>
September 14, 2010 </p>

<p>The Institute convened key scientific, governmental and business leaders in Washington, D.C. to help shape the Institute&#39;s work on adaptation metrics and accompanying communication and demonstration projects initiatives. Here, participants discussed the Institute&#39;s prioritization of key sectors, such as water and food, and how metrics could help accelerate government and private sector action on adaptation.</p>

<h3 id="internationalworkshoponglobaladaptationmetrics">International Workshop on Global Adaptation Metrics</h3>

<p>Washington, D.C.<br>
October 27, 2010</p>

<p>The Institute gathered scientists, researchers and economists from top international universities, consultancies and research centers to address technical and political issues surrounding <a href="https://www.gain.org/content/global-adaptation-institutes-world-meeting-adaptation-metrics-draws-top-experts">adaptation indicators</a>. Determining how metrics can help prioritize investment in adaptation and  measure the impact and progress towards greater resilience were key goals. </p>

<p>Participants stressed that adaptation indicators must address both social behavior and biophysical vulnerabilities and highlighted key elements that make indices useful, verifiable and influential. </p>

<p>Here, the concepts of vulnerability and readiness found in the Readiness Matrix, were further refined. The Readiness Matrix measures the relative vulnerability of countries against the degree to which a country is prepared to deal with climatic and environmental changes, </p>

<h3 id="firstworkingversiongainindex05">First Working Version: GAIN Index 0.5</h3>

<p>Washington, D.C.<br> 
February 2011</p>

<p>Internally, the Institute began gathering and testing different indicators and indices that met the recommendations from the previous scientific convenings. Such metrics reflected the concepts of vulnerability (a country’s exposure, sensitivity and ability to cope with climate related hazards) and readiness (the ability of a country’s private and public sectors to absorb resources effectively toward increasing resiliency to climate change and other global forces).     </p>

<p>A working model that combined that combined vulnerability and readiness indicators to create a single ranking of countries and place countries throughout the Readiness Matrix was created. </p>

<h3 id="consultationonthegainindex">Consultation on the GAIN Index</h3>

<p>Washington, D.C.<br> 
May 3, 2011</p>

<p>Scientist from <a href="https://www.gain.org/content/bringing-adaptation-world-stage-global-adaptation-institute-concludes-first-annual-meeting">around the world</a> joined the Institute to critique and offer advice to improve the GAIN Index working model and transform it into a viable, livable and useful index. The Institute considered and implemented many of the methodological, indicator selection and audience-targeting suggestions offered from a variety of scientific, political and communications perspectives. </p>

<p>The meeting concluded with the formation of a <a href="https://www.gain.org/content/world-renowned-experts-join-global-adaptation-institute-council-scientific-advisers">Council of Scientific Advisors</a>.</p>

<h3 id="revisedversiongainindex07andconsultationwithcouncilofscientificadvisors">Revised Version: GAIN Index 0.7 and Consultation With Council of Scientific Advisors</h3>

<p>Global<br>
July 18, 2011</p>

<p>The GAIN Index data was partially ported to Microsoft Excel, from Google docs, for faster development. Revisions to the selection of readiness indicators were made as well as an expansion of vulnerability indicators to take into account infrastructure indicators and differentiate between indicators of quantity and quality. </p>

<p>The Institute&#39;s Council of Scientific Advisors provided feedback on the latest working version of the GAIN Index before opening it up for public feedback. </p>

<h3 id="openconsultation">Open Consultation</h3>

<p>Global<br>
August 15 - September 9</p>

<p>The Institute dedicated a website to review of the GAIN Index, version 0.8. <a href="https://www.gain.org/content/measuring-what-matters-global-adaptation-institute-launches-open-consultation-process-global">Feedback was sought</a> from Institute contacts from around the world as well as through press releases and other communications materials. </p>

<p>Individuals from 13 countries commented through this venue. The majority of reviewers were from an academic or NGO background. Most respondents found the GAIN Index&#39;s tracking of information throughout time to be very important as well as the inclusion of income-adjusted scores and rankings. Many respondents agreed that subnational level scores are important as well. Reviewers responded that NGOs, governments and private investors would be the audiences for which the GAIN Index is most relevant.    </p>

<p>In addition to individual feedback, the Institute held meetings with several prominent environmental and public policy think tanks and organizations. These included, The Brookings Institution, The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, The World Resources Institute and The Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>Ongoing revisions were incorporated into the GAIN Index 0.9 until final release of the GAIN Index 1.0. </p>

<h3 id="releaseofthegainindex10">Release of the GAIN Index 1.0</h3>

<p>Global<br>
September 14, 2011<br></p>

<p>On September 14th, the Institute <a href="https://www.gain.org/content/global-adaptation-leaders-unveil-index-help-private-public-sectors-prioritize-investments-ad">released</a> the GAIN Index version 1.0 to the public, accompanied by a data-intensive website devoted to making the GAIN Index easy to use and reference, transparent and downloadable. The website was implemented using node.js and MapMill.</p>

<h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>The Institute welcomes recommendations for additional indicators, data sources and methods that can improve both the accuracy and usefulness of the GAIN Index. The GAIN Index will evolve over the next few years, but we will seek to stabilize its structure and measures so that it can become a reference point to assessing progress.</p>

<p>Some of the next steps we are already considering include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>County comparator: A side by side comparison of the country´s performance on all measures and time.</p></li>
<li><p>Subnational scale: Adaptation takes place in the local level. One of our criteria when selecting measures has been to search for scalable measures where possible. Higher granularity is a difficult but important step looking forward. We are exploring ways to undertake this step.</p></li>
<li><p>Include ecosystems and urban settlements on the Vulnerability Axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the country´s awareness of its Adaptation needs and actions taken. I an similar token, include accurate reporting levels as part of the score might be of interest.</p></li>
