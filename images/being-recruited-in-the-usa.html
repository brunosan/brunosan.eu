    <div class="instapaper_body entry-content">
    <p>There is a lack of engineers everywhere, but finding talent is especially hard on the Bay Area.</p>
<p>I'm from Spain but I've been the last 3 months in San Francisco attending to some conferences and visiting some friends.
At that time I was trying to start something but I changed my mind and I started looking for a job instead.</p>
<h3>Getting in contact</h3>
<p>Every single company I visited was recruiting.
Companies were constantly providing pizza, beers and smart people talking about smart things just to attract talent.</p>
<p>I sent many resumes but the 90% of the times I didn't receive any response. I just didn't know what was missing.
I have a CS degree, +5 years of experience and lots of <a href="https://github.com/masylum">open source contributions</a> on cutting edge technologies.
I guessed companies were not willing to sponsor me a <code>H-1B</code> visa.</p>
<p>I was about to come back to Spain when I received two calls from a couple of companies.</p>
<h3>The interviews</h3>
<p>The first interviews are always telephone interviews. They ask you about your background, some theoretical questions and some <em>puzzles</em>.</p>
<p>Then it's time for face to face interviews, which can be up to three hours long!
You talk with people from different departments, answer more questions and solve more <em>puzzles</em> on whiteboards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a function that calculates square roots</li>
<li>Sort and concat arrays in a optimal way</li>
<li>Guess the two missing numbers in a array with <code>n - 2</code> length containing <code>1..n</code> unsorted numbers</li>
<li>Calculate the number of digits for a given number</li>
<li>Implement a function to detect palindromes</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of them are doable but I think they are probably missing amazing developers that may not know how to solve those problems,
but they are capable of solving real-life problems (fix this bug, port this library, refactor this code...).</p>
<p>Some of the theoretical questions I had (mostly javascript related):</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a closure and which disadvantages has</li>
<li>What is hoisting</li>
<li>How does <code>this</code> work</li>
<li>How <code>float</code> works and which issues have</li>
<li>How does the event loop work on the browser and how to delay a function to the next tick</li>
<li>How to optimize CSS, and how does specificity work</li>
</ul>
<h3>The offers</h3>
<p>Both companies offered to sponsor me a H-1B visa and a good salary.
I ended up accepting one of the offers because they where more transparent with the stock options and because
they told me that I could work remotely until getting the visa.</p>
<p>I signed the contract, opened a bank account, left my job and came back to Spain.</p>
<h3>The silence</h3>
<p>Back in Spain I started to prepare myself for the new job. I learnt Python because I saw some people using it at that company's offices.
I was super motivated and willing to start!
I even sent some emails to the CTO to get some instructions on how to setup my development environment.</p>
<p>At my starting date I received the first email from the CTO saying that they were not able to get my visa and that they were thinking about the whole remoting thing.
I answered them that it was not a problem for me. I've been remoting for a while and it had never been an issue.</p>
<p>What happened next? Nothing. Silence. I was ignored completly.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Getting a working visa is not easy. Companies should start to be more open minded with remote workers.</p>
<p>There is a huge deficit of talent on the USA, and a lot of wasted (and way cheaper) talent on other countries.
An average engineer in the bay area can cost around $100k. In Spain, the same engineer costs less than a half.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>Ironically, While I was in San Francisco I was working for <a href="http://www.teambox.com">Teambox</a>, a company based in Spain.
It was an amazing experience, the development was happening 24 hours a day. The git repository was constantly receiving commits, never sleeping.
We used <a href="http://talkerapp.com">talker</a> and <a href="http://www.teambox.com">teambox</a> to communicate and we had exactly the same problems others have working insite:</p>
<p>Who broke the specs? They were green yesterday! <code>git blame</code> ...</p>
