I consider myself a inquisitive open-minded person, advocating for a better world where Science, Technology and Society get to understand better each other. We live amazing times, where we are exposed to much more information, where we can reach much further and where making change is easier than ever. Huge chances for a better world are possible... Parallely,  chances for the worse are also possible. Technology makes us lazy, procrastinators and dependent. I see both Science and Technology as tools. Tools for welfare, tools for leverage, tools for a better tomorrow. It´s up to <strong>us</strong>. Now, more than ever, we (all of us) are responsible for the future, and our actions are indeed votes for the world we want to live in. Dare not to join?
