title: "[Idea] NASA Outreach made by kids"
---
Just a few hours ago I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brunosan/status/26386800540909569">tweeted</a> about a nice <a href="http://random.brunosan.eu/beautiful-video-for-nasa-by-reidgower-alanmla">video</a> by Reid Gower. He made it for NASA as a way to complain for their poor outreach strategy, specially in social media. I even made a Twitter mention to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AlanMLadwig">Alan Ladwig</a> (Asso. Administrator for Public Outreach at NASA HQ). I met him at this <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/CurrentProjects/SSB_057195">conference</a>.

Complaining is easy. But, what would then Reid Gower do? He doesn´t say. <strong>What would I do, then?</strong> I have quite some ideas, but I think is fair to share at least one. Here it is: Let kids and enthusiast announce and explain some of your discoveries.

The main point in outreach is to bridge the gap between the 'Science world' and the 'Real world'. Surely a discovery will be extremely exciting, beautiful, and important for a researcher, but it won´t reach far if you can´t <em>translate</em> it. I am talking mainly about the language, but I am also talking about the viewpoint. The beauty the scientist sees involves much training, numbers and equation with meaning to him. You need to translate that, keeping the same passion.
