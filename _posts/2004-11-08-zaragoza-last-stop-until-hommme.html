title: Zaragoza, last Stop until hommme ....
---
Altought the plan was to stay at Torino and went to FLorence 4 days more... money reasons (the lack of it, in particular) made me decide to come back to Barcelona and go right to Asturias without spend some days with my friends there... Right now I´m in Zaragoza cause I decided to make the 2 halfs separately to visit friends here and make the trip easier...
<br />So, the AEGEE-trip is almost over... It was G r e a t. 5 days at Crete, boat (big boat, with cine, disco, ...) culture, parties (also at Priviledge-Heraklion), gyros pita, traka, sublaki, chachiqui, plotokó, cafe frappe, ...., akropolis, agora, museums, .... I´ll put some photos son.
<br />
<br />On the way back we stop at Italy to go to the general assembly of AEGEE, 800 people parting all together, meetings, chatting with our friends from all over europe, .... Also Torino and Milan deserves the visit.
<br />
<br />PD1:I miss a lot the people there at grecee, specially Konstandina... THANK YOU!! hope to see you again...
<br />PD2:I tihnk in the last 10 days i slept 30 hours...
