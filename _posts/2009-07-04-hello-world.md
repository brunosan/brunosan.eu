My old hosting was provided for free by my good friend <a href="http://www.aldeaglobal.net/martiminoves/">Marti</a>. It ran on its own system under a VPS. Neat. Unfortunately Â It turned to be not such a <a href="http://forum.x-cart.com/showthread.php?t=48019">good system</a>. Since a couple of week I was having several problems with the memory, speed or performance.

After trying a couple of hosting services I realized that all I need is a basic platform to host my few pages. This webpage aims to support communication with people. On certain few occasions it has thousands of visitor (like when I published on <a href="http://nasonurb.wordpress.com/work/apod/">APOD</a>), but normally is just a virtual presentation card.

So, welcome to <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>. It is quite limited and not so customizable, but is reliable, fast and free.
