###Scientists###

* It's not about the Science
* Warning is the easy part
* Facts don´t change opinions

###Policy makers##
including those who *negociate* our future at COPs

* Mitigation won´t do it. Also Adaptation
* Open Data will bring a common refernece point.

###Communicators###

* It´s not about metling ice
* Bring it to here, to now

###Private Sector###

* They are not called
* They are not calling
* We need them.
* Why would they join?
