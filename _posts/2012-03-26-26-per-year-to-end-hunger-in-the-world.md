title: 26$ per year to end hunger in the world
---
The cost of ending hunger globally is less than the value of wasted food only in the US, and orders of magnitude smaller than the Wall Street bailout.
<blockquote>"The world only needs <strong>30 billion dollars</strong> a year to eradicate the scourge of hunger."</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;"><a href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000853/index.html">FAO Newsroom</a>. 2008</p>

<blockquote>"14-15 per cent of United States edible food is untouched or unopened, amounting to <strong>$43 billion</strong> worth of discarded, but edible, food".</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_waste">Wikipedia</a> quoting a <a href="http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Business/US-wastes-half-its-food">study by the University of Arizona</a> in 2004</p>

<blockquote> During the last quarter of 2008, central banks purchased <strong>US$2.5 trillion</strong> of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history.</blockquote>

<!--more--><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Amadei">Bernard Amadei</a> mentioned this numbers at the Opening keynote of <a href="http://www.ewb-usa.org/conference/">EWB-USA conference</a> (I hope they upload the video soon). I got curious and I check the numbers. Then it occurred to me to divide that cost among us, the ones who have the most, and I found out that:
<blockquote>The cost of ending hunger is <strong>26$ per year per person</strong> for those living in a <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups#High_income">high income country</a>.</blockquote>
To get this number I took the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">population data and GDPpc</a>. Then I ordered the countries by Income and divided the 30 billion $ by the aggregated population of countries ordered by GDPpc. If you want multiply that number by 10 to reflect the case where only the top 10% of the population would give. Wouldn't you give 260$ a year to <em>end hunger in the world</em>?
