This is an experiment using all location information and sensors, including:
* GPS if available: location, precision.
* Cell Network: location, precision, cell towers number and strength.
* Gyro: Position of the phone.
* Compass: Nort, strength (to make a magnetic map)
* Microhpone: White Noise baseline. Peak to baseline amplitude.


Crowdosuced map of magnetic disturbances, cell power (similar to
OpenSignals)

Use all available data to invert the location (so it can be used
automatically for indoor location, floor detection, ...
