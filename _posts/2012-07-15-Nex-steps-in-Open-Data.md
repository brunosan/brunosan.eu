title: Next Steps in Open Data
---
Last week DC hosted the [Open Goverment Data
Conference](http://www.data.gov/communities/conference), the
[Tech@State](http://tech.state.gov/profiles/blogs/tech-state-wiki-gov-agenda), the
[Wikimania](http://wikimania2012.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), and [more](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/july/09/week-dc-tech/). It seems clear
the momentum for open data and Technology innovation is growing strong.

While you can read plenty of good reviews from these events I feel some
important points regarding Open Data of *where the ball is going* are left amidst the background of *where the ball is*:

* Don´t be ashamed of the knowns unkowns.
* Open Data from the inside out, and at home.
* Standards, standards, standards.
* The challenge of non publicly funded open data.
* Hackathons, and competitions can backslash on you.

###Don´t be ashamed of the knowns unkowns###

If you are succesful with Open Data, it will allow you to quickly know
what you know. How much, or little you actually know. In fact, this means you can
easily pinpout gaps in data, gaps in knowledge. This *half empty* view
is also important. Yet, if you advocate to Open your Data, focusing on
the half empty won´t really help you.

When we participated in Apps for Development, our initial idea was an
app to preciesly pinpoint these gaps in data. We wanted to know the
known unkowns. And, on a positive side, try to interpolate those gaps
and enable crowdsourcing of the accuracy of the estimates. I was
particualry excited about it. However, we thought the Bank would
probably want to focus on the *half full* side of the Data Repository.
When the voting started, I chuckled when I saw the [Gap Finder](x) app from
[The Benedict](#). He was not among the finalists.

This is why I was so gald when Caroline Anstey, Managing Director of the World Bank [talked
explicity about the Blind Data app](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/10/second-international-open-government-data-conference) on her Opening Keynote at [IOGDC](#):

>I’d also like to think we’re just as open about what we don’t know. One
>of the first apps a developer created when we started our Open Data
>Initiative in April 2010 is called “Blind Data”- it shows the gaps in
>coverage of our various development data. **We have to be honest about
>those gaps. Showing them clearly, creates an incentive to fill them.**



### Open Data from the inside out, and at home ###

When the World Banks engages into Open Data not only helps externaly by
providing information to the world to what are they doing, but it also
enbales the bank to actually what are they doing when, where, for how
much:


### Standards, standards, standards###


### The challenge of non publicly funded open data###

>"Open Data is a public good, for the public good"


data should be a public good, so that anyone can leverage on it. The
challenge is that data gathering is usually an expensive endevour. Also,
data itself is the core asset for many business models.

The cost of data is lowering, but it still needs heavy funds. Typically
a public sector entity (govs, international agencies) will fund these
efforts. The challenge is for the private sector who also collects and
uses data, to open their archives. Doing so their competitive advantage
will dissapear. This common (and easy) business model confronts Open Data.

This challenge resonated in several sessions at IOGDC, without much
answer. If "data belongs to itself" who pays for gathering it?


###Hackathons can backslash on you###

Unless one pays close attention, these events meant to grow the
development ecosystem, can actually shrink it. Participating on such
events invloves very intense sessions brainstorming, coding and testing your
apps. The *first tier* of apps, the winners, are obviosly incentivated to continue and rewarded for
their efforts. But, I argue, it´s the *second tier* where you should
focus. Those developers that made very good products but you could not
reward them. They have invested a lot of time and energy, they have
learnt a great deal, and now they walk away. They are the untapped
resource that can make the diffence.

When we got to be finalists for *Apps for Development* with [Know your
World](#) I wondered about this a lot. Our participation was purely for
fun, but I know many other participants invested much time and hopes. I
contacted a few months later. Many said they were less likely to
participate again on similar competitions. Why? The bitternes of too
much completely unrewarded effort.

At IOGDC one of the pannelists shared one possible solution. Enforce, as
a requirment for participation, to include a business model around any
app. This completely changes the environment. One can still reward the
best, but also showcase this *second tier* to help them get traction.
If you really believe your app is good, the competition helps you kickstart it,
and you can continue withput them.

My point is that [Good](http://hackdaymanifesto.com/) Hackthons and Challenges are not about the prizes or
the apps, they are about growing the community, and that should be the
focus, not the prizes.


<strong>Apps for Development winners one year later</strong>

Almost exactly one year ago, at last year’s Spring Meetings, President Zoellick <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22888693~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html" target="_blank">celebrated</a> the 15 winners of the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/appsfordevelopment" target="_blank">Apps for Development</a> global competition that challenged software developers to create apps related to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) using World Bank data. The competition complemented the Bank’s <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">Open Data initiative</a>, and encouraged non-traditional audiences to use the Bank’s datasets.

Still, the question that dogs most apps competitions is “So what?” What happens after the awards ceremony and photo op? Where do the software developers go from here? Have they been able to scale their applications’ use to a wider audience?

The most valuable part of being recognized as one of the winners is the 'stamp of approval' of the World Bank, which gives other organizations confidence in using the application for their own purposes,” said first prize winner Frank van Cappelle, a PhD student at the University of Melbourne.

Van Cappelle’s app, <a href="http://www.statsilk.com/maps/statplanet-world-bank-open-data" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">StatPlanet</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">—which helps users explore more than 3,000 Bank economic indicators with interactive maps and graphics—was customized soon after to visualize country, regional and global performance data on 19 key education indicators, released under the name </span><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/node/647" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">EdStats</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"> by the Bank’s Human Development Network. Paid customizations of StatPlanet are also under way for several organizations who wish to modify the app to better suit their purposes, including the International Food Policy Research Institute and the UN MDG GAP Task Force.</span><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:xx-small;">
</span>

<span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><img class=" wp-image-2344 alignleft" title="14006008" src="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/14006008.gif?w=156" alt="" width="156" height="300" />
Similarly, the competition served as a launch-pad for Athman Mohamed of Kenya, who created <a href="http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com/submissions/665-factcha-stop-spam-advocate-for-the-mdgs" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">FACTCHA</span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, an app that turns the few seconds Internet users spend to verify themselves as humans (e.g., secure id boxes) into time spent raising awareness about the MDGs. Rather than typing random words and phrases, FACTCHA-users are quizzed on their knowledge of the MDGs. Since the competition, Mohamed served as the technology lead for the </span><a href="http://opendata.go.ke/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">Kenya Open Data Initiative</span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, which successfully put Kenya on the global map as one of the first countries in the developing world to open up their government data. After receiving a commendation from the Ministry of Information for his efforts, Mohamed now serves as director of ICT for Trade and Transport Facilitation at a $400 million non-for-profit trust where he previously served in management.</span>Spaniard Dr. Bruno Sánchez-Andrade Nuño was a finalist for the app </span><a href="http://www.quiz2015.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Know Your World</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, an interactive quiz of 17,000 questions fueled by Bank data about the Millennium Development Goals. Sánchez believes his participation in the competition led to a leap in his professional career: he is now the director of Science and Technology at the Global Adaptation Institute, where he works with data and development issues.</span>

The competition also benefited the Bank in unexpected ways. Allowing unfettered access to the Bank’s treasure trove of data helped Bank staff uncover issues in the datasets and technical glitches that otherwise would not have been discovered so quickly. The ability to correct these issues as they arose bettered the quality of the data and the ability to access it with ease. It was a win-win situation.

<span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">The reach of Apps for Development was striking. In the six months leading up to the deadline more than 80,000 visitors from 200 countries visited the </span><a href="http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">website</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">. Software developers from 36 countries entered more than 100 software applications, which ranged from data visualizations to mobile apps. More than half were submitted from </span><a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22823055~menuPK:34457~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Africa</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, Asia, and Latin America. In fact, Africa was the region with the most submissions overall.</span>

With Apps for Development receiving such a tremendous response, the World Bank Institute’s <a href="http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/approach/innovation" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Innovation Practice</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"> is now developing a </span><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/challenge" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">World Bank Challenge platform </span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">to institutionalize the process and to support a wide variety of competitions. Indeed, the </span><a href="http://intranet.worldbank.org/WBSITE/INTRANET/INTRANETHOME/0,,contentMDK:23061893~menuPK:64140059~pagePK:6426483~piPK:6402841~theSitePK:86048,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Apps for Climate</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"> competition was launched in December during the United Nations Climate Summit in Durban, South Africa. Surely, this is just the beginning.
