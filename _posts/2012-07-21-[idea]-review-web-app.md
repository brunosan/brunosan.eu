An app that overlays the option to comment, tag, edit or change any html
element.

The idea is to work with any page, just like you short-link a page, the
shortcode send you to the same page, but with the overlay so you can
put your name and make the edits.

No login, no setup, just send a short link to anyone to request them to
send you edits.

bonus. Text edits can be made pull requests if Jekyll.
