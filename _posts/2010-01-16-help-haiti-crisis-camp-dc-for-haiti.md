title: Help HAITI, Crisis Camp DC for Haiti
---
Details on the <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/wiki/index.php?title=Haiti/2010_Earthquake">Crisis Camp</a> can we found here.<br /><br />I just realized it is actually pretty easy to help. What we are doing now is helping with the GIS (localizing stuff on maps for now). <br /><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a> is an open source map that is being used by people on the ground to locate roads, places, …<br /><br />The things is that really helpful and detailed satellites images are being gathered, but the information on it needs to be located.<br /><br />To help just do this:<br />1.- Go to <a href="http://osm.org">osm.org</a> and make an account.<br />2.-Locate a place that needs to be worked on. The Downtown area is quite covered so may be is good to go a bit further out.<br />3-Go to "Edit mode" clicking the button.<br />4-Add a backgroung image to start adding roads. We are using an image recently donated by Digital Globe. The URL is http://maps.nypl.org/tilecache/1/dg_crisis/!/!/!.jpg<br /><br />5-That´s it. Here´s a short video on how to do it.<br /><a href="http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf">http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf</a>
