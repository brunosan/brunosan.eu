<strong>Dr. rer. nat. (magna cum laude):</strong> <em>"Observations, analysis and interpretation with non-LTE of chromospheric structures on the Sun"</em>

<img class="aligncenter " title="cover-cover" src="/media/cover-cover.jpg" alt="cover-cover" width="197" height="300" />


###Goal

The Sun possesses a complex layer called chromosphere, which extends
above the overwhelmingly bright photosphere. With decreasing
density, the solar magnetic fields start here to dominate the dynamics,
giving rise to new and intricate phenomena. Thus, the chromosphere
represents a challenging field of research, from both observational and
theoretical aspects. This work comprises the observation of the
chromosphere with very high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution.
The image analysis, as an important step towards high quality data,
is highly involved. We apply various methods and compare the resulting
image qualities. The chromosphere is studied both on the solar disc
and at the limb. Furthermore, we give interpretations of the observed
phenomena by means of current theoretical models. More than a
century after its discovery as vividly red rings during total solar
eclipses, the chromosphere has remained a paradigm of the
marvellous complexity of our Sun.




###Progress

* *2004-09-01*: Granted Fellowship to start January 2005.
* *2005-01-05*: Moved to Göttingen to start doctorate.
* *2007-12-01*: Written dissertation submitted.
* *2008-02-15*: Oral Dissertation and exams done. Final grade for PhD, *Magna Cum Laude*   
* *2013-02-15*: Got the idea of recording a 100s video of what my thesis
  is about, as science outreach. TBD
