After collaborating with Crisis Mapping and some [very
small](http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/changeset/10289378)
contributions, I wanted to learn how to
contribute to the basemap in OSM with my own GPS tracks.

DC, where I live, is pretty well mapped, so I had to wait. When I went
to Rio+20 I realized that the [Pão de
Açúcar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarloaf_Mountain_(Brazil)) only had points for the
Cable car station and a couple of main tracks. And these were mapped
using a non-nadir satellite image with considerable slanted view. Since the Pão de
Açúcar has a high height/width ratio, the projection effect displaced the track
at the top by several meters. 

###Goal

The goal was to map as best as possible the top of the *Pão de Açúcar*
with my Android device using the built-in GPS and with no data
connection. Then upload my tracks and POIs.

###Progress

* *2012-06-10*:  Prepping the device installing OSM data for the region,
  and [OSM
tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker&hl=en) for recording tracks.
* *2012-06-17*:  Mapping day.
* *2012-06-27*:  Tracks uploaded. 

###Lessons Learned

Basic mapping using an Android device is quite simple. Just wait for
best coverage, and remember to store POIs such as shops, views, names,
..., or at least make
pictures of them so that you can fill all the detailed information later
on when
uploading to OSM servers.

To introduce the changes and upload the changeset I used
[JSOM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/)

###Resources

* My [GPS tracks](http://goo.gl/iyXvw) are available.
* [OSM Changeset](http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/changeset/12041189) with my new nodes and tracks.
* Comparison of Google Maps with no information for tracks on the right,
  and OSM on the left (even more nodes are available if zoomed in, such
as shops, restaurants, toilets, ...)
