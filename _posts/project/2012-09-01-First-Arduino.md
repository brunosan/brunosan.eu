[Arduino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) is a popular open-source single-board microcontroller. As a programmable modular hardware platform, it has an extreme wealth of applications. E.g. Arducopter project uses an Arduino core. This project is intended to familiarize myself with the hardware, programing language and make some proof-of-concept applications.


###Goal

* Learn the basics of the [Wiring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiring_(development_platform) development platform (IDE and language)
* Create a couple of sketches using various sensors:
    * IR sensor & IR LED - Create a IR remote control cloner.
    * Proximity sensor: Display distance to object.
    * Integrated Display

###Progress

* *2012-09-03*:  Acquired basic Hardware: UNO motherboard, LED,
  resistors, capacitors, proximity sensor, ...
* *2012-09-03*:  Tested I/O set-up. Fired "Hello World" and basic examples.


###Resources

* [Github repository for all sketches]().
* Pictures of I/O setup and the ON/OFF DIY box:
