Balloon mapping is creating aerial maps using Helium Balloons. The idea
is to minimize the cost and entry barriers so that anyone could do it
with minimal resources and as fast a possible.

This is specially relevant for developing countries, crisis response or
citizen response to events like e.g. coastal oil spills.

You can read more about Grassroots Mapping
[here](http://grassrootsmapping.org/).

###Goal

The Goal here is to get to know the technique and get familiar with the
challenges and benefits of grassroots mapping using balloons. We chose to map a small region inside the Rock Creek and one of the
bridges.

##Progress

* *2012-05-06*: Hardware delivered (as a birthday present, thank you
  guys!). Corresponds to this kit available online from [Grassroots Mappers](http://shop.breadpig.com/collections/publiclaboratory/products/balloon-mapping-kit)
* *2012-05-20*: Mapping event. Managed to get Helium and map a small
  section of the Rock Creek and bridge as planned. Mapping scope reduced
due to DC regulations for objects in the sky. 
* *2012-05-25*:  Quick and dirty map stitching using SeaShore.   

###Lessons Learned

**Helium**

Getting the Helium proved to be the biggest challenge. One needs to
find a place to buy the Helium which hinders its usability in crisis
response or anywhere far from such shops ( i.e. country side, developing
countries, ...) 

Stocking up Helium beforehand and carrying it along
 seems the best option. Yet, this significantly increases the size 
of a "Balloon mapping kit" and has others limitations such us travelling with a kit which otherwise fits inside a small bag.

It would be very desirable to build a solution to recover
the Helium once used, specially given the challenges with Helium supply. 

**Wind**

Balloon mapping is suitable with none to low wind conditions. Even a
small wind can create vibrations and swings on the camera that greatly
difficult the stitching, specially when the camera doesn't point to the
nadir.

Using a very low-tech DIY wind stabilizer greatly reduces the shaking
(Image provided below).

If you need to map under increased wind conditions you should try kites
instead of balloons.

**Stitching**

We found best results recording high quality video with our Android
phones. This allows to pick up the best frames when the shaking is
minimal, and the cameras points towards the nadir.

Stitching can be done purely by hand using any image manipulation with
layers, such us Gimp or SeaShore.

If you want to do some serious stitching we recommend the online stitching tool [Mapknitter](http://mapknitter.org/), or the GNU tool
[Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/). They both need some training.
