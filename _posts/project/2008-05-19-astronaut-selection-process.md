On April, 2008 ESA
[opened](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Astronaut_Selection/SEM3TR0YUFF_0.html) the application phase their next round of astronauts.

The Selection Phases were as follows ([more
info](http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Astronaut_Selection/SEM3V4R03EF_0.html)):

1. Prospective candidates fill in an online application.  
2. Selected applicants need to upload a private-pilot medical examination certificate.
3. Psychological Test I. 
4. Psychological Test II. 
5. Medical Test. 
6. Professional Interviews. 
7. Decision by the Director General of ESA. 

>The ideal candidates should be competent in relevant scientific
disciplines, such as life sciences, physics, chemistry and medicine
and/or be an engineer or experimental test pilot, and should have
demonstrated outstanding abilities in research, applications or the
educational field, preferably including operational skills. A good
memory and reasoning ability, concentration, aptitude for spatial
orientation and manual dexterity are also prerequisites. Applicants
should be fluent in English (Russian being an asset) and should have
high motivation, flexibility, team competence, empathy with others and
emotional stability.

Since I signed an NDA I will only restrict here information that is
freely available online, mainly from the ESA website.

###Goal

I knew the chances were infinitesimal, but I wanted to try it, and enjoy
the experience. Who wouldn´t want to be an astronaut!

###Progress

* *2008-05-15*: Obtained Private Pilot medical Certificate.
* *2008-05-17*: Astronaut Application submitted.
* *2008-05-21*: Application approved and selected for continuing the process.
* *2008-07-04 *: Selected for phase 3: Psychological Test I.
* *2008-08-xx *: Psychological tests, a full day of tests in Hamburg (Germany).
* *2008-09-01*: Application **not** selected to continue :(


###Lessons Learned

[10.000
applications](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Astronaut_Selection/SEM3ZTRHKHF_0.html) were received. 
Of those, [8413 application](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Astronaut_Selection/SEM3ZTRHKHF_0.html) were selected to continue. 
Just [923 were
shortlisted](http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Quiere/ser/astronauta/elpepisoc/20080824elpepisoc_1/Tes) to continue to the first round of
Psychological Tests. I was one of them, but I did not make it to the next
cut, where only [200
applicants](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Astronaut_Selection/SEMAIXRHKHF_0.html) continued.

The Psychological Test I in Hamburg was an exhausting full day of tests. For courtesy to ESA, and the NDA that I signed, I cannot tell details, but you can get a glimpse of a subset of the tests we made [here](http://webservices.esa.int/eas/sampletest/).

I am very honored to be selected for the first phases, and also very
frustrated to be left aside. Nonetheless I can say I am on the
honorable pool of 923 europeans that passed though the first phases of
the process.

I must also thank ESA for the great experience. Not only the facilities
were of high quality and staff were very professional, but also the
lodging and travel arrangements were all taken care of.

While on this process, talking with other candidates and knowing the
requirements failed but I could do, I ended up adding a few items to my To Do lists (Run a
marathon, scuba dive, parachute jumps, learn some Russian...)
  
###Resources

[Not much available due to the NDA]

* As part of the process ESA asked us to familiarize ourselves with the
  type of tests for the first round. Some time later, they made those
[tests available here](http://webservices.esa.int/eas/sampletest/). 
* On my blog I talk a bit more [about the experience](/2008/09/16/bruno-astronauta/).
* Another pal who got rejected and wrote about it [on his
  blog](http://www.colinmcnulty.com/blog/2008/07/24/booo-esa-rejected-my-astronaut-application/).
* ESA has a nice brochure about the process
  [here](http://www.cienciaviva.pt/rede/space/home/astronautselectionprocess_EN.pdf).
* [Medical requirements](http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/eac/ESA_Astronaut_Applicant_Medical_Examinations_List.pdf) to enter the selection process (equivalent to JAR-FCL 3 Class 2)
