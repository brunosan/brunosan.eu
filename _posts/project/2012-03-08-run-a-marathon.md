In 2011 I decided to try a marathon. I had read many years ago that the
most common age to run it is around 30, so I waited.

Now that I´m 31 I decided to try.


###Goal

* Finish one marathon, training for it and trying to enjoy it.

###Progress

* *November 2012*: Started training for the April Washington DC Rock and Roll marathon. I was
  training with the five fingers, and I got injured a month into the
training. Too quick. Ended up running the half in 2 hours and
considerable pain on my hip.

* *October 2012*: After 100 days of training, [I ran the *Marine Corps
  Marathon* in 4h54m](/2012/10/29/Running-a-marathon/).

###Resources

I wrote [a post about the experience](/2012/10/29/Running-a-marathon/). I really think the stride, being
vegan, and keeping up the motivation was the key to do it.

...and btw, the most common age is around 45, so I still have a few year
of running.
