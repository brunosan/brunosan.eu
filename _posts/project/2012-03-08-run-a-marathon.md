In 2011 I decided to try a marathon. I had read many years ago that the
most common age to run it is around 30, so I waited.

Now that I´m 31 I decided to try.


###Goal

* Finish one marathon, training for it and trying to enjoy it.

###Progress

* *November 2012*: Started training for the April Washington DC Rock and Roll marathon. I was
  switching over to the five fingers, and I got injured a month into the
training. Too quick, too much. Ended up recovering and being able to run the half marathon in 2 hours, and
considerable pain on my hip.

* *October 2012*: After 100 days of training, [I ran the *Marine Corps
  Marathon* in 4h54m](/2012/10/29/Running-a-marathon/).
* *November 2012*: what started as pacing a friend, ended up as my
  [second marathon](/2012/12/02/2nd-marathon/). Surprisingly much smoother, and a tad faster.

###Resources

I wrote [a post about the experience](/2012/10/29/Running-a-marathon/). I really think the stride, being
vegan, and keeping up the motivation was the key to do it.

...and btw, the most common age is around 45, so I still have a few year
of running. My itch now is either an ultra, or a triathlon.
