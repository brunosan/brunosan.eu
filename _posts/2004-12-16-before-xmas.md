I´ve just been accepted (who would refuse me?); so next year I will be at the Goettingen Observatory with a Max Planck fellowship to do my doctorate about Chromospheric Structures.
<br />I will arrive there the 11th... and my director already booked me an apartment.
<br />In fact I fell a bit  doubtful wether I would be able to be on such a good level... (Am I prepared?) Just in case I bought "Fundamentals of Plasma Physics" :D
<br />
<br />So my "holidays" are filled with plasma studies, trying to learn a bit of German, ....
<br />.... ok, I just read 10 pages of the book and I listened half German tape :D
<br />
<br />But one thing arrived yesterday .... My new iBook!! I am so happy with it :D in fact I writing from it... still getting used to my new doll...
<br />
