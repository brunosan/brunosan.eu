A couple of days ago we went online with the webpage of one of my projects:

<a href="http://solarastronomy2009.org/">The Solar Physics Task Group website</a>

<a href="http://www.astronomy2009.org/">The International Year of Astronomy 2009</a> is a global effort initiated by the International Astronomical Union and UNESCO to help the citizens of the world rediscover their place in the Universe through the day- and night-time sky, and thereby engage a personal sense of wonder and discovery.

<!--more-->The night sky harbours countless marvels to make any human wonder about its existence. However, during half of the time our sky is dominated by the Sun. We are all familiar with its heat and light, and that it drowns out almost every other light above. Our Sun is by far the closest star to us. The Sun-Earth relation is a key point in understanding our relationship with the Universe. It serves as a paradigm of other Universe bodies. It represents an extremely rich and practical educational resource. It is important to every society. Its brightness facilities a wide range of educational activities that can be carried out in the daytime. Therefore, the Sun is the perfect point from which to begin our journey to the Universe.

The goal of this Task Group is to help the International Year of Astronomy 2009 with solar matters. It aims to communicate the link between the Sun and the rest of the Universe, and so the place of solar science in astronomy. Our means are the suggestion, organisation and support of solar related events for IYA2009 and being the reference desk for solar matters. Our network reaches every solar field and professional observing location.
