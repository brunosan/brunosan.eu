Antonio claimed in the future we´ll use QR-codes and our phones to identify ourselves online:

I tend to agree, and this is one way, I think, it could work. Just scanning 2 QR-Codes either by using your phone's camera or the computer´s camera.

	<li>The server (e.g. Gmail) asks who you are. You <strong>show your QR-code</strong>. That code would be created on the phone using the algorithm that changes the patter every few seconds. The QR-code is read by the integrated camera most computers now have.</li>
	<li>The server accepts the ID, but still needs to confirm he is a trustworthy server and that that the login/QR-code was just not used by someone else. The server connects with the phone (since it knows the info from the QR-code) and send a random number with which the phone makes another QR-Code. The user has to<strong> show the new QR-code</strong>.<span style="line-height:24px;font-size:medium;">You are now sure that the person holding the phone is the person trying to access the account.
</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height:24px;font-size:medium;">[Extra] The server (or the phone) shows few pieces of information only the user would know. Some correct, some not. If you click the wrong one, you are out. Both server and phone log you out.</span></li>

If the phone has a camera:
