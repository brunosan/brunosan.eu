<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/cms/"><img class="size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter" title="merged_banner1" src="http://www.brunosan.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/merged_banner1.jpg" alt="merged_banner1" width="531" height="90" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The 100 Hours of Astronomy cornerstone project is a worldwide event with a wide range of public outreach activities including live webcasts, observing events and more taking place during a 100-hour period in early April.  One of the key goals of 100 Hours of Astronomy is to have as many people as possible look through a telescope as Galileo did for the first time 400 years ago. 100 Hours of Astronomy will take place from 2-5 April when the Moon goes from first quarter to gibbous, good phases for early evening observing. Saturn will be the other highlight of early evening observing events.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The new web site of the 100 Hours of Astronomy Cornerstone Project is now online.  This new site has new content and features.  More importantly, the new site provides the capability for many new features as IYA2009 begins and we all prepare for the 100 Hours of Astronomy in April.</p>

There is new information on each of the global events, including the opening event, the live science center webcast, the live 24-hour research observatory webcast and the 24-hour global star party.  Much more will be added as planning continues.
<p style="text-align:left;">I am part of this project, so I am particularly proud of the progress.</p>
