A must read from Elon Musk: http://www.spacex.com/usa.php

If there are cost overruns, SpaceX will cover the difference. (This concept may be foreign to some traditional government space contractors that seem to believe that cost overruns should be the responsibility of the taxpayer.)

Facebook could have started <strong>an entire space program</strong> for less money <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/zuckerberg-closed-instagram-deal-without-facebook-board.ars?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+arstechnica%2Findex+%28Ars+Technica+-+Featured+Content%29">Zuckerberg</a> spent on Instagram.

The entire cost of SpaceX's history to develop all these technologies is less than a SINGLE launch of the Shuttle by NASA.
