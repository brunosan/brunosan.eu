<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Tax by 401K, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355404323/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6056/6355404323_cf97f9c58e.jpg" alt="Tax" width="350" height="233" /></a>
I believe in Taxes. Not sure how much percentage is fair, which services  should be provided, or whether I agree to the spending, but the concept is just. That´s why I post this.</p>
<!--more-->Mine was a tax complex year. Started unemployed, 3 months as international contractor for USA in Spain, and then employee in the USA. I decided to pay<a href="http://www.hrblock.com/"> H&amp;R Block</a> (leaders in the market of tax preparation) to make the taxes for me.

<a title="H&amp;R Block Entrance by ChrisM70, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrism70/1084788799/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1212/1084788799_20916f65ab_m.jpg" alt="H&amp;R Block Entrance" width="240" height="160" /></a> It took <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/">H&amp;R Block</a> one hour to make them. The guy was 50% of the time distracted talking on the phone or to other employees. He seemed to know what he did, but was a bit hesitant when doing the foreign income credit. He spoke broken spanish. His english was neither good, he could not spell "Scientist" or "Environment" (I am not kidding, I had to tell him twice, and write it down). The cost? <strong>400$</strong>. I would say is <strong>highly overpriced</strong>, and they will not explain the cost... All they said was that it was expensive because I had non-common stuff. I doubt I´ll go ever again. If only IRS had a "<a href="http://www.agenciatributaria.es/AEAT.internet/Inicio_es_ES/_Configuracion_/_top_/Ayuda/Preguntas_y_errores_mas_frecuentes/Campanas/Renta/Renta_2010/Renta_2010.shtml">Programa PADRE</a>" (they draft it for you, free).

<em>Spain Taxes:</em> While in Spain I <a href="/2011/04/04/soy-profesional/">worked</a> for a USA company, that paid me into a USA bank account. But I worked via Internet from Spain, so I became an official tax-paying spanish contractor (<a href="/2011/04/04/soy-profesional/">this is how you do it</a>). From the money I made then, I paid to <a href="http://www.agenciatributaria.es/AEAT.internet/Inicio.shtml">Hacienda</a>, as non-resident, roughly <strong>23%</strong> of taxes. I even called the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">IRS</a> and they told me that that amount would be discounted. In the end it was only partly so, but fair. I guess.

<em>USA Taxes:</em> From my income in the USA (the one I made while at Spain and my normal salary) I paid, after all adjustments, roughly <strong>13%</strong> of federal taxes and <strong>5%</strong> DC state taxes.

In total, for all goverments, I´ve paid around <strong>27% of income tax.</strong>

These numbers don´t really match the general tax brackets (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States">USA</a> or <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impuesto_sobre_la_Renta_de_las_Personas_F%C3%ADsicas_(Espa%C3%B1a)">Spain</a>), but I am not a typical case.

Now, I do feel proud of paying taxes. We need them, <strong>everyone</strong> should pay their taxes. In Spain 22% of the Economy is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_sector">believed</a> to (illegally) evade taxes. 8% in USA.
