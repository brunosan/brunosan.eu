###Scientists###

* It's not about the Science
* Warning is the easy part. Action must follow.
* Facts don´t change opinions. Impressions do. In the mind of the
  average citizen, climate change is quite down the list of worries. If
you want to encourage them to take action, link to their worroes, relate
to those. Use hisotires to link consecuences.

###Policy makers##
Policy makers, including those who *negociate* our future on
international venues such as Rio+20 or COPs.

* Mitigation won´t do it. Also Adaptation
* Open Data will bring a common refernece point.
* Don´t make it only about sharing the burden. CC also brings
  opportunities, leverage, new priorities, .... 

###Communicators###

* It´s not about metling ice
* Bring it to here, to now

###Private Sector###

* **They are not calling, or being called**. If one takes a look to the last COP17 or Rio+20
  it is clear theat there is an increasing presence of the private
sector, but only on the side events. They are hardly present on the main
events, neither talking or asking questions. 
* **CC needs the private sector to finance more than 90% of the cost.**
  Cost estimates are very rough but vary between 70 to 200 billion
dollars per year, only for Developing countries. Of these cost, only
roughly 1% is currently available via the public sector.
* CC, specially Adaptation offers new markets, products and services.
* **Protect your Assets and Investments**. Facing CC is a Corporate Social Responsability but above it, is
  the need to protect assets and investments (factories, transportation,
production chains, ...)
