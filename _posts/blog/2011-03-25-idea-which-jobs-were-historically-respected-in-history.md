<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12-02-19.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1891" title="Screen shot 2011-03-25 at 12.02.19" src="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12-02-19.png" alt="" width="640" height="269" /></a></p>
This is another quick idea I came up some days ago. I´d love to program this, but got no time... can you help me?

A parser to plot the profession breakdown on biographies of people in Wikipedia, along History. The point would be to see a graph that, over time, shows which professions where more dominant for people that went into History (or, quite different in the Internet era, those that are Wikipedia worthy).

<!--more-->I am quite sure we would see the philosophers era in Ancient times, the king´s era in the middle ages... or the Renaissance time filled with artists and scientists. On the 20 century I thing we would also see many scientist and politicians, but also an increasing percentage of actors, journalists, and <em>celebrities. </em>These ones probably dominate today. This is just an <em>educated </em>guess...

To make a quick calculation, for the last few hundred years, I used the Google Ngram Viewer. <a href="https://bsan.eu/gKWaxW">This is the result</a> searching books published between 1750 and 2008, in English, and with phrases containing:  was a scientist, was a journalist, was an actress, was an executive, was a millionaire, was a king, was a poet or was a musician:

<a href="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-10-56-33.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1885" title="Screen shot 2011-03-25 at 10.56.33" src="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-10-56-33.png" alt="" width="640" height="280" /></a>

Kings and poets dominate, so let´s remove them:

<a href="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11-05-03.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1886" title="Screen shot 2011-03-25 at 11.05.03" src="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11-05-03.png" alt="" width="640" height="236" /></a>

One can already read many points on these graphs but I´ll just leave some key points:
<ul>
	<li>These past centuries are not the best, comparatively, to be a poet (or a king, for obvious different reasons....)</li>
	<li>Scientists seem to pass their point of fame in the public view on the first half of the 20th century (no wonder, that includes Einstein, Bohr, Watson, ... and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries#20th_century">many many others</a>)</li>
	<li>Journalists emerge the fastest among all these profession. they are the ones that write the news, so there is a <em>possible</em> sampling bias there.</li>
	<li>All but the actresses seem to correlate with, my bet, industrial revolution. With the industrial revolution we seemed to create space for other means of work and culture...</li>
</ul>
To try to test that final thought, I <a href="https://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=industry%2Cculture%2Cscience%2Carts%2Ctechnology&amp;year_start=1750&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=5">searched for</a>: industry, culture, science, arts

<a href="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11-25-492.png"></a><a href="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11-36-43.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1890" title="Screen shot 2011-03-25 at 11.36.43" src="https://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11-36-43.png" alt="" width="640" height="256" /></a>
<span style="color:#444444;">This graph, to me, reads:</span>
<blockquote>Before the Industrial revolution, <em>arts</em> where an important component of what society called <em>culture</em>. The incredible rise of <em>industry</em> took <em>science</em> along with it. Soon after <em>science</em> kept on climbing alone on an incredible array of sustained discoveries and progress, with only a subtle drag on <em>culture, </em>but <em>arts</em> kept falling<em>. Industry</em> jumps up again and this time bringing <em>culture</em> quite much with it. 40 years ago or so, a concept called <em>technology</em> took an amazing rise, even bringing industry down, and with a quite apparent correlation with <em>culture</em>. And unfortunately <em>arts </em>keep falling.</blockquote>
Obviously there are many other factors than should be checked before talking to any kind of correlation (or relation). These include wars, crisis, education, television, ...

But I step down here. Sociology is certainly an incredibly interesting, and difficult, subject.

Coming back to the original idea, I´d love to see with which professions History chose to paint the walls of time.
