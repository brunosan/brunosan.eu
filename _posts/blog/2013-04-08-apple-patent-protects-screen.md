How to avoid breaking your glass screen when you drop your phone?
Phones fall down, and sometimes nothing happens and sometime the screen
shatters. Can it be avoided? Making the glass thicker is a solution but
increases the weight. I got an idea to fix that.

  Today I was attending a talk by [Mark P Mills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markpmills/) on Patent Law at the Notre
Dame Law School. He mentioned that Apple had just patented a way to
prevent shattered iPhone screens, but he didn´t go to the details,
just that he thought it was difficult.

Apple indeed [has a patent to protect the hard
disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_Motion_Sensor) when your laptop
falls. They do so by detecting a free fall via accelerometers. When the
laptop detects it has been dropped it will park the read/write heads of the hard disk,
thus avoiding those heads scratching the surface of the disk when it hits the ground.

But how do they protect the screen? The idea would then be to detect a
free fall, and quickly orient the phone in the air so that it touches
ground on the back, or on the side, or whatever position is deemed most
likely to help survive the phone with minimal damage.

When I wrote this post I didn´t look at the patent, but I thought about it and this my idea:
Drop the battery.

Rotating the phone mid air requires a burst of energy. You could get
there using puffs of air, but that would take space for the hardware.
You could also use gyroscopes (like satellites use) but they are not
that quick. You need to move a significant portion of the phone mass to
rotate the thing quickly.... the battery.

The idea is then to insert 4 special screws on each corner of the
battery. When the accelerometers detect that the phone is falling, it
 would calculate the momentum of inertia (how exactly is the
phone is rotating) and carefully release 2 of the screws to create a
counter momentum of inertia that compensates
that rotation. As the battery unwinds the rotation is compensated. If
the rotation needed is less than the full 90˚ turn, the other
2 screws will also be released, letting the battery separate at the
exact moment the phone is properly oriented ( thus reducing also the weight on impact).

To gain more momentum of inertia of the rotation of the battery, one could increase the angular speed using screws with small springs. Here is a
quick sketch of the whole thing:

No idea is that is what Apple thought of, but may be there is a chance
Apple would finally make replaceable batteries in the end. :)

Update: For reference, as I upload this, I find the [Apple patent
online](https://bsan.eu/17nQ1bv). I still thing my solution is better and
simpler :)
