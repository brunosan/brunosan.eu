I was going to Spain for a few days and I had to maps. I was going to
meet people in places I´ve never been and I was going to do a little road
trip. Tipically I would have bought a SIM card at the airport at then
use Google Maps. I think data was something like 1€/day and it dropped
from 3G to 1G after a few Mb. Similar thing in Germany and South Africa.

This time I wanted to try something different. I wanted to try without
buying a SIM card. Basically rely on pre-downloads and occasional WiFi
spots. It worked perfectly. Not only for maps but also to be somewhat on the loop
for email and social (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter...). For maps I used
[OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/).

[OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/) is awesome. You have the usual global map,
you can search for places, you have directions, even turn by turn
directions. But, you can **also** do all that offline, and you can
submit bugs to the map, add roads that are not present, ... and all that
is synced back to [the commons map](http://openstreetmap.org) once you are online.

This is how it worked in my case:
