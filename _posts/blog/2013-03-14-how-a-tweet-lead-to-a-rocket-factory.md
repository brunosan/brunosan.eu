Don´t be afraid to poke around with the data at hand. This is the little
story of how I got to visit Space X, the rocket factory, back in 2010.

I had arrived for a conference in Irvine late in the evening. This is when I worked as a fellow of the Space Studies Board of the National Academies. I checked in to the hotel, and had no plans until the conference next
day. I went to the bar for a quick bite. It occurred to me that may be they
had a Foursquare deal, so I used my mobile to *check in*. Indeed they had
a free appetizer if you ordered a beer. Cool.

I also noticed someone else had check-in there 10 minutes before. Out of
curiosity I clicked her profile and she had a linked Twitter account. She
was a science journalist. Few
minutes before she had tweeted about the same appetizer I had ordered. By the picture
it was pretty clear she was the person next to me at the bar. So I
talked to her. 

We started chatting about Twitter and Foursquare which were fairly
unknown by
then. Really nice conversation. Then we talked about the conference, our common background
interest in space and what not. I must have had a poker face when she asked If I knew Space X.
Turns out she is a really good friend of
Elon Musk, and she was going to visit the rocket factory. She then offered to bring me
along.

Elon was somewhere else taking care of some Tesla thing that day, but that´s how I got a personalized visit to Space X, by the hand of an astronaut. They were extremely nice, specially considering they had to take extra precautions since I was a foreigner ( ITAR restrictions )

Don´t forget to check-in and tweet, folks.



This post is inspired by this nice story where X landed a job at Mapbox.
It also started with a tweet.
