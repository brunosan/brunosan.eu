One day, I will not be lucky, fit and crazy enough to do a triathlon. That
day was not today. I did the [Nation´s
triathlon](http://nationstri.com/) which is an Olympic
tri: 1.5 km swimming, 40 Km on the bike and 10 Km running.

<!--more-->

"That day is not today" is what I was thinking when I woke up at 4am. I committed to this
back in January and since then I had racked up around 500 running miles,
700 miles riding the bike and 60 miles swimming. Far below from any online
plan. I was relying on just finishing and having done 2 marathons last
year.


7:10 am and I´m eagerly waiting in line on the platform over the Potomac 
for the whistle to jump into an unknown experience. 
Was my training enough?, Can I finish this?, Should I start slow, like a marathon?, 
Will the other swimmers kick me?...
As the whistle sounds I jump mechanically into the void. For a moment everything is
mute. No sounds from the loudspeaker, nothing to see but brown water. I
wait to surface and the race is on. 

Forward, pushing always forward. I mentally focus on the training I´ve
done, *this is the same thing, just not in the pool*. The turnaround of
the swim is
below the bridge far away but I focus on each 100m buoy. It is not easy
to sight your bearings and avoid other people. As I am breathing towards the
turnaround I get a glimpse of the sunrise over the river waters.
Beautiful. Life is beautiful, and I´m so lucky, and crazy. Hopefully fit too. 
I can feel my body tunning into swimming mode, so I focus on
keeping it, reaching out, long strokes, just like the pool. I start to
see people from previous waves (another color cap), feels great. I know
I´m not a good swimmer, but I´m holding good. Getting to shore feels
amazing. Swimming is my hardest leg, and it´s done.

I run to the transition zone, but my body commands to slow down. I just
can´t run. Too tired. I walk a bit, get to the bike, gulp some water,
some dates, and I´m out with the bike. I´ve only done 2 long
rides while training, it is not my bike and I don´t have clip pedals,
(so I´m riding with my running shoes). Still I have aerobars that you can lean forward
and be aerodynamic. This is going to be interesting. 2 loops of 20 Km each. 

Right on the start a guy with a fancy white bike passes me in a swoosh, and
without thinking I push to get him. These bikes can be 10.000$ but I´m
ready to challenge myself and try my best with the gear I borrowed from a friend 2 days before. Drafting is not allowed, but I 
speed up to get him because I want
to push myself, I need to or I´ll be too slow. I pass him back and
another guy with another fancy swoosshy red bike passes me. And I go
again. The three of us spent the whole 40K passing each other, every 5
minutes at most. I think this was the key to make an awesome bike leg. I
*averaged* 26 mph (36 km/h). I could hardly push further. We were not
the first, but only a handful
other riders passed us. I had to force myself to drink and eat energy
gels. As we were cruising the city I got glimpses of the landmarks, the
river, the monuments, the sun. I felt lucky, fit, and great. Suffering and
enjoying it at the same time.

Back to the transition zone. On my forearm I had written my row number.
It is hard enought to run but the transition zone is like an beehive of
people getting out of the swim and the bike. Drop the bike. Get a bite of an energy bar,
and off to the run. No thinking. It was hard to mentally deal with running one more hour, but 
I had no pain, just tired. No excuses, you´ve done a great job so far. The running movements felt uneasy, forced and new. Can I do this after
the swim and the bike? Yes, this  is just a 10K run. i*You´ve done many of these runs training!* 
I tried to recreate the feeling of my long training runs or the end part of a marathon, hoping I would find
my running state soon. I also saw a guy running slightly faster than me
ahead, so I focused on him. Humans evolved hunting as persistence runners,
and it also makes it easy to empty your mind.  I need to keep the distance to him. It was
hard, I could hardly push more, and I had to keep it for one hour more.
After 15 minutes or so, they guy ahead saw his family, he sped up, so I
was loosing him. But
then he slowed down a few feet later. He was mine. I passed him and tried to look for
another moving target. I started feeling better so I pushed more (run
listening to your body they say). Only 4 miles to go. I was going to do
it.

At this point your ups and downs swing quickly. The sun is shinning,
a few runners are now passing me super fast, but I focus on my body.
It´s hard, challenging, but I can do this, and I enjoy that. Again this
weird feeling of suffer and joy at once. No pains at all. The track deviates and it´s
very hard to turn when the end line was just straight ahead. The only
thing keeping me running now is the body inertia of the pace. If I stop it´s over.

As I turn the last bend and I see the arch at the finish line, I start to
smile. I can barely sprint as I had wanted, but I can hold this pace (which turned
out to be faster than most of my trainings). Every step feels me with
joy, pride and the feeling of *completing* and triathlon. No idea of the
time, but it´s here. I cannot resist to smile, throwing the hands up in victory, and
people cheer for me. I´m coming alone. The guy with the loudspeaker reads my number, checks the
name and he is cheering me by name. Also Antonio and Aniceto are
shouting but I didn´t hear them. The last steps are pure joy, pure
challenge but knowing it´s done. Pretty tired, but no pain anywhere, and
feeling absolutely amazing.

Turns out my estimate of 3 hours was way off. [My official time](http://nationstri.com/results-2013-results.html#/results:&AthleteSearch=397&Division=All:1378680178590) is 2 hours 34 minutes, an incredible
time to me. The swimming was just on par to my best trainings in the pool, the
bike was the best of my legs, where I *averaged* 36 km/h on a mostly
flat course. The run was 47 minutes, 7:35 minutes per mile (my record in 10K -only running-
is 44:15 minutes). Many things could have gone wrong today, but few could have gone
better. I can´t say being vegan helps or not, but
I lost a few Kg in this training (again, like for the marathon, I´m
around 145 pounds/ 65kg) and I feel great.

Overall I really enjoyed this challenge, but the training is just too hard.
Just like I felt training for a marathon, the training is worse than
the race, more so on a triathlon. Swimming is hard, and bike is both
dangerous and time consuming. Training often, training several sports
in one day, gathering the gear, ... Crossing the line is an amazing
feeling, and the most visible step of a huge challenge. Kudos to
everyone who raced today, or is currently training.
