title: Zaragoza, last Stop until hommme ....
---
Although the plan was to stay at Torino and went to FLorence 4 days more... money reasons (the lack of it, in particular) made me decide to come back to Barcelona and go right to Asturias without spending some more days with my friends... Right now I´m in Zaragoza because I decided to make the trip in two legs and visit some friends here, and make the trip easier...
<br />So, the AEGEE-trip is almost over... It was G r e a t. 5 days at Crete, boat, culture, parties, gyros pita, traka, sublaki, chachiqui, plotokó, cafe frappe, ...., akropolis, agora, museums, .... I´ll upload some photos soon.
<br />
<br />On the way back we stop in Italy to go to the general assembly of AEGEE, 800 people partying, meetings, chatting ... from all over Europe, .... Also Torino and Milan deserved the visit.
<br />
<br />PD1:I miss a lot the people there at Grecee, specially Konstandina... THANK YOU!! hope to see you again...
<br />PD2:I think in the last 10 days I slept 30 hours...
