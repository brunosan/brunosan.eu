Today the *World Economic Forum* ([WEF](http://www.weforum.org/)) [announces](http://www.weforum.org/news/world-economic-forum-announces-young-global-leaders-class-2013) this year awards of  "Young Global
Leaders"
([YGL](http://www.weforum.org/community/forum-young-global-leaders)). 
I am one of them.

According to the website: 

>"Young Global Leaders represent the future of leadership, coming from all
>regions of the world and representing business, government, civil
>society, arts & culture, academia and media, as well as social
>entrepreneurs.

>Nominated under 40, these young leaders are proposed through a qualified
>nomination process and assessed according to rigorous selection criteria
> accepting only the very best leaders who have already demonstrated their
>commitment to serving society at large."

Back in May 2012 I was asked by a work colleague who was interested in [our
work](http://index.gain.org) if I minded to be [proposed to be YGL](http://nomination.younggloballeaders.org/nominationform.aspx). I didn't know what that was, but we then talked about my life, and the motivation behind my perhaps peculiar professional path. Plain honest conversation.

 I then read a bit about the
[YGL](http://www.weforum.org/comawardeesmunity/forum-young-global-leaders), and I was
highly impressed. Nominations go through a internal and external
evaluation and screening
[process](http://www.weforum.org/content/pages/nominate-young-global-leader). Some of the previous awardees include Sergey Brin (Google), Jimmy
Wales (Wikipedia), Marissa Mayer (Yahoo), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), and countless other successful CEOs, ministers, athletes, ... I found a wonderful Youtube Channel with short videos to "[Meet the YGL](https://www.youtube.com/user/yglvoices)". Very motivational and impressive.

And so I forgot about my nomination.

To my surprise, just few weeks ago, I received an email with this Subject:
> "You Have Been Honored as a Young Global Leader 2013"


And so I started receiving information about the group,
activities, a fellow "mentor", events, ... Turns out I am the only spaniard this year.

Since then I have spent some time back on that YouTube channel, reading
information provided, talking with fellow YGLs, interacting with the YGL headquarters in Geneva and hunting tweets and blog posts of other YGLs.

I don´t know yet what really *is* the YGL, but I am certain this is an amazing opportunity
and an honor. I am truly humbled and
thankful for this nomination. Reading the roster of fellow YGLs, I can only take this
as an acknowledgement of a trajectory that is still very short. It has
not been easy, and the passion that drives me rejoices with this
opportunity: a clear motivation to help bring Science
and Technology closer to Society. 

Being a YGL, I am told, is a transformational experience. Certainly, having the
chance to get to know such a *Forum* of *doers* will be motivating.

For now, I´m planning to squeeze as much time as possible to take the
most of this opportunity WEF is offering. Let´s do it.
