Today is my last at GAIN. Almost 3 years dedicated to bring a pragmatic view of the challenges of climate change adaptation. It has been a wild ride. I´m very proud of the work we´ve done and very thankful to everyone I´ve work with. I´ve truly learn a lot, profesionally and personally.

GAIN continues as NG-GAIN, now housed inside the University of Notre Dame. In fact I´ve spent the last 6 months dedicated to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. I will remain a very close friend and supporter, but now it´s time for me to move on to the next chapter on this journey. I´ve dedicated the last decade to broaden the impact of science. GAIN has been an important step, but I am thrilled to step up on that commitment.

*I don´t know where is the limit, but I know where the limit is not.*

3 years ago I would have never expected I would be working on climate change adaptation. I didn´t even know what that was. I had just quit my posdoc on space science fully commited to my idea, but no place to do it.
