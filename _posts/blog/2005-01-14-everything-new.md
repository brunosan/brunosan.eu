title: Everything new...
---
I am writing form my new office at the Göttingen Observatory, where I am supposed to be 3 years to do my doctorate.
<br />Everything is new... the work, the place, the country, the friends, the language, the house, ... I am still getting used to it... still landing my new life.
<br />
<br />I will need a couple of months to enter the quiet routine, without bureaucracy and all that stuff...
