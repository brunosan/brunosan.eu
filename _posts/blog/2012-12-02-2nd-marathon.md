Last week I ran the [NCR **Trail** Marathon](http://ncrtrailmarathon.com/) in Baltimore. This is only 4
weeks after my [first marathon](/2012/10/29/Running-a-marathon/).

I didn't actually train for it, as it was not on my plans four days
before the race. I crossed the start line breaking plenty of 
recommendations, like getting some time off, new shoes, new
clothes, no music for the first time, first trail race, no setting goals
or paces, ... 

Somehow I managed to pull quite an enjoyable race and beating my best marathon time.

 A friend of mine was running this race with someone else, but that person
cancelled. A thought I could just join my friend. The race takes place
north of Baltimore, so he had to take the train the day before, then the
tram, get a hotel, go to race, and then come back. I decided to go with him,
start the race to help him pace. I had run my first marathon only 4
weeks prior, so I didn´t want to push my body for too much. Deep inside
I also wanted to try, as I felt pretty well recovered from the first
race.

This is a **trail** marathon but, thankfully most of it goes using an old
train line. This means that it goes through a forest on an unpaved road but is mostly
flat. The course is back and forth, with roughly a 75m elevation change
in the turn around:

One of the most important rules I´ve read about marathons is never to
try something new on the race day. Well:

* First time travelling for a race, with all the hotel, eating changes,
  and not seen the race track before.
* New shoes.
* Forgot my *Gu* energy gels at home, so I planned on just using dates as fuel,
  and a couple of *Gu* I could get.
* New thermal clothes, since it was going to be quite cold.
* First time running without music. (Not allowed, but then most people
  had music... too late!)
* I´ve never paced someone else or run with anyone.
...

This is also a small race in the forest with 400 participants, not a 30.000+ in
DC, so most of the time you will be alone, and probably among better runners.

##The race

This is the School where we gathered before the race:

When I crossed the start line, my goal was to keep my pace not faster
than a 4:30 marathon, and run along my friend. Right on mile 3 or so, we
decided to split ways. I was feeling great so I
increased the pace  a little bit, but always keeping it slow. Reading my
bpm after the race, I managed to keep it well below my anaerobic limit of 150,
and I was running pretty smooth in the 130-140 range. It was quite cold so
sweating was not a problem, and the new tighter clothes kept me warm without chaffing risk. I was
running on a small pack of 4 people, without minding my pace much, any
race strategy or anything. It is surprising how your mind just drifts off. I had
no music but watching the forest around, feeling my own body and keeping
the pace of the group was actually good. I didn´t miss the music at all.

Since I only had 3 *Gu* energy gels instead of the 6 I used in the
previous marathon, I decided to keep the dates I had brought for breakfast
and eat 2 every 30 minutes or so. I rationed my *Gu* to eat one each way on the half point
of the back and forth track, 
and also one the turn around. I have to say that it feel much better on the stomach and I had 
no lack of energy compared to using twice the gels like last time.

Getting to mile 13 was quite a good feeling. I only had to go back. It
is a bit of an irony that you ran all these miles only to find a
sign that says, "turn around". That's the image at the top of
this post.

Despite having only run once since the last marathon 4 weeks prior I was
in pretty good shape. I had a small pain on my right hip, which I think
might be for running too slow. My hypothesis is that I was running
slower than I usually do, so I started to bounce up and down instead of
down and forward. That little extra bounce down was being absorbed by the
knees and hip, and hence the pain. And of course, the lack of training.

On the turn around I made a small pause to make the picture and also drink water. When
I went back, after a mile or so, I decided to do the rest of the race, 
now slightly downhill, enjoying the forest and pushing a little bit more. 
According to [Strava](http://app.strava.com/activities/29711289#) that has all
my runs since 2009, on that second half marathon I made my best ever 400m
(4:07min/km) but also best 1/2 mile, 5km, mile, 10 km, 15 km and 10 miles. 
I think I overtook 50 runners or so in the second half.

The famous mile 20, where many people *hit the wall* went by and I was
managing the struggle. The pain in the hip was worse but I wanted to
finish without walking. Unfortunately mile 24 had a horrendous slope
that I just couldn't do, so I walked it. A fellow runner cheered me to
push, as the finish line was just a mile away. It was hard, but I went
back to running, and when I saw the end I managed to squeeze a sprint to
cross with 180 bpm, a full smile and the surreal fact I had done a faster
marathon.

##Results data

The [results for all runners](http://www.charmcityrun.com/content/results/ncrtrail_mara_res_12_post_a.htm) are already available. This time there is no
location data, so no mapping for these runners. What I could do is
create the [same visualizations as last
time](http://brunosan.eu/2012/10/29/Running-a-marathon/), and compare the
statistical results with the last race. 

This race is 8 times smaller, and my hypothesis is that you
would find mostly good local runners yielding better times on average,
runners from far away trying to qualify to other races, like Boston,
also faster, and also another set with slower local runners trying the distance.

When I was nearing the turn around I found the runners on the lead.
Turns out that the second one, who was already struggling when I saw
him, was running his first marathon, and he did not use the water stops, or
had any gel. He was crazy fast, and I later knew he hit hard the wall
around mile 18 and was taken to the hospital. Not a joke!

> Note: For the comparison of this race (NCR) with the Marine Corp Marathon (MCM)
I had to normalize the histograms to the total number of race
participants. Otherwise the NCR histogram is too small to be seen.
So when you see 0.04 on y axis it meas 4% of the finishers.

## Runners by Age

{% image NCR-age.png %}

66% of participants were male. Most women were actually grouped
on the 35-40 bin. Compared to the MCM, the 25-30 women were mostly
missing, but on the other side, there were more women 35-40. 
Numbers for women are much more concentrated than men, whose biggest group
was 45-50 years old. Overall there seems to be less younger
participants.

## Runners by time

{% image NCR-time.png %}

In terms of time, this race (which is 7 times smaller) deviates
significantly from the nice Gaussian shape of the MCM. Smaller races
don´t yield scalable results. The *4 hours
milestome* is much more apparent in both men and women, with another
peak for women around 4:30. After that time, there is consistently better
times for this smaller race than the more popular MCM. Big races attract
slower runners. On the other side fast runners are proportionally much
more prominent, specifically faster men. 


{% image NCR-scatter.png %}

Combining both dimensions one gets again the scatterplot of Hours by
runner Age and Gender. As I was mentioning in the beginning, the
smaller NCR race seems to attract mostly faster runners, regardless of
Age. The group of faster men in the outer rim is still apparent but vague.

From this plot one can also see the bigger more famous MCM race is able to
attract many more (overall) slower runners, specially on the 15-35 age range.

Most of the results lie within the envelope of the bigger race, which
thus indicates that a bigger, more popular race, also includes the type
of participants of smaller races. 


{% image NCR-scatter2.png %}

Also like last time, I try to estimate those who are not able to keep a
constant pace, and e.g. hit the wall on the second half. This does not
include those who have to leave the race, as only finishers are taken
into account. This might be important, as I can guess that the cold
temperatures made many walkers quit the race.

NCR runners on this smaller race seem to be able to keep their paces
much better. The graph is remarkably vertical without much deviation on
either side. The *Wall* is barely visible with an impact of less than 1
hour on the finish time.  

Again women seem remarkably better at setting a pace and keeping it the
whole race.

###Some extra Resources

* All the python code and data for the visualizations is available on
  this [github repository](https://github.com/brunosan/NCR).
* I used this nifty [Flickr
  Visualizer](http://www.darckr.com/username?username=brrc) to check all
race pictures quickly and find the only one among 400 or so where I am.
