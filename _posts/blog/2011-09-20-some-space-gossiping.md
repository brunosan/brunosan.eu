<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KH-9_HEXAGON_satellite.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2032" title="KH-9_HEXAGON_satellite" src="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/kh-9_hexagon_satellite.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="396" /></a>

Back in the 70's there was a american secret satellite that took pictures called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-9_Hexagon">KH-9 Hexagon</a>. The size of a bus, developed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office">NRO</a>. I took pictures of the soviets... on a huge film the width of your extended arm. This was back in the analog era. The film had to be mechanically packed on space on a container the size of a washing machine. It had to be de-orbited with small rocket from space to parachute over the Ocean. A plane had to snag the thing and deliver it to a lab, probably on a ship that could develop the film. All top-secret.

Something went wrong on one of the first missions. The plane failed to hook the packet mid-air and the film sunk in the Ocean. Big problem, since the film inside had top-secret information. The Navy had to deliver a top-secret submarine mission to pick up a top-secret canister from the middle of the ocean floor that had top-secret information before no one knew.

How amazing is that?

I had known about it for a few months, but it  was still classified information. Now is not. That story was de-classified earlier this year, and the satellite itself only a <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1568">few days ago</a>. If you like space or the Cold War, you'll love the<a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1785/1"> full version of this story</a>.
