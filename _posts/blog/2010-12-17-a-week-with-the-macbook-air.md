title: A week with the MacBook Air
---
It´s been a week that I have the MacBook Air. The small 11 inches one, with 64 Gigs of storage and 4 Gigs of RAM. One friend asked me about it, and another one wanted help to set up his new Mac. I used to have a page for setting up a new Mac, but it was lost on my recent migration from<a href="http://www.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~bruno/APOD/apod.html"> my old german webpage</a>. For them, and everyone who might find it of help, here is my <strong>not complete</strong>, or even <strong>fair</strong>, review, with some points and recommendations.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Welcome home Ms. MacBook Air. by brunosan, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/5238337232/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5238337232_4bae72e415.jpg" alt="Welcome home Ms. MacBook Air." width="400" height="300" /></a></p>

What I like:

First of all, <strong>it runs OSX</strong>, my main reason to choose an Apple.
<ul>
	<li><em>Thin</em>. On the thick part is 1.5 times a USB plug. On the thin part is thinner than half a USB plug (0.3 cm!). That thin it can actually <a href="http://jensche.wordpress.com/swiss-macbook-air-cuts-bread/">cut bread</a>.</li>
	<li><em>Instant</em>. Having the SSD drive makes it amazingly fast. I never turn it off (close the lid when done, open the lid when back), but it takes like 10 seconds to fully boot up.

	<li><em>Silent</em>. In the week I had, the fan was never on. Or I don´t hear it. And I did some lengthy compiling when installing MacPorts.</li>
	<li><em>Light</em>. It weights 1 Kilo. 2,3 pounds.</li>
	<li>Looks great. Not important, but you´ll work many hours on it. It is easier to appreciate something when it looks so nice.</li>
</ul>
Yes, I really like it. All other laptops will look way to thick, heavy, noisy and slow. The unibody technology makes it feel sturdy.

What I don´t like:
<ul>
	<li>The bezel around the screen is too wide.</li>
	<li> The keyboard does not have light.</li>
	<li>There is no external indicator of the battery level.</li>
	<li> There is no pulsating light indicating the laptop is sleeping.</li>
	<li>No IR remote sensor.</li>
	<li>For the moment, there are no cases or sleeves for it.</li>
	<li>The batteries cannot be easily replaced. I <strong>hope</strong> they last more than 6 months with 75% of the capacity...</li>
</ul>

So far, I don´t miss the DVD drive or the extra storage. My SSD drive is 64 Gigs. I have a external 500 Gigs (2.5'' 1xUSB powered ) with a copy of my old mac, and the Time Machine backup for the Air. I only plug it to run my old iPhoto library from it (pressing "alt" on run) and add new pictures. I think I´ll set up my old mac as a home server and connect remotely when needed. Or may be just move to the cloud. It seems that having a cloud drive with your stuff might not be so expensive.

2 USBs seems a working minimum. Actually makes me wonder why not make a truly universal socket. Like a USB but also for the external monitor, for Ethernet, for AC, ... It kind of makes sense.

The battery lasts forever. I tested it for my flight from DC to Frankfurt. On the gate, on the flight, on the train. Summing up to almost 8 hours of use (no WiFi, no movies, just typing and reading on medium brightness). The charging time is like 1 hour. One caveat. Make sure flash is not running or it will cripple the battery to half the duration. You can check that on Activity monitor, and also kill it.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="7:28 hours of battery with my MacBook Air. oh, yes. Ésa es mi Mac ina! by brunosan, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/5242700436/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5125/5242700436_bf8347d06e_m.jpg" alt="7:28 hours of battery with my MacBook Air. oh, yes.

It does not have Ethernet, only WiFi. I thought I woud not need it, as most of my environments have WiFi (Home, hotels, cafe). As true as it might be, I ended up buying the USB to Ethernet adapter 2 days ago. Another thing to carry along, together with the monitor adapter and the charger.

In conclusion. The laptop is expensive compared to seemigly similar netbooks. Yet I would argue that the quality, finish and underlying OS makes it ahead any other option. At least for me. The price is also similar to a MacBook Pro. For my usage, and my estimation of where the market goes, the Air was the winner.

Instead of migrating from my old MAC, I chose to start from scratch. These are the steps I did to have it up and running:
<ul>
	<li>On first boot I choose the new account option. In German (both to practice german, but it turns out it also works as security measure).</li>
	<li>On Settings:
Mouse click on tap, drag with 2 taps. Scroll with 2 fingers.
This should be default, on every laptop on earth.
No auto-loginLanguage switch icon on top bar. Nonetheless I try to use the spanish locale (I ordered a spanish keyboard)</li>
	<li>Software update: 1 Giga!!! Over Wifi! Hope you have a WiFi b/g/n speed router.</li>
	<li>Activate Google syncs on Address Book, Mail  and iCal.</li>
	<li>Installed these basic apps:
Chrome (and sync bookmarks)
QuickSilver (icon on top. Bezel skin. Also install <strong>clipboard</strong> module)
Prey <a href="http://preyproject.com/">http://preyproject.com/</a> (Locate your stolen laptop)
DropBox. A must.
GeekTool. Another must.
TweetDeck
VLC
Perian
Afloat, to keep windows on top when needed. <a href="http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/#download">http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/#download</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/#download"></a>All icons out from Dock. Only remains, Terminal and Chrome. I use Quick Silver for calling apps.</li>
	<li>Hidden apps are translucent in the Dock. Put this on Terminal:
defaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool YES</li>
	<li>Add a 'recent things' stack to the Dock:
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ "tile-data" = { "list-type" = 1; }; "tile-type" = "recents-tile"; }'</li>
	<li>Install Developer tools. It is not on the included recovery USB drive, so you have to get it from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/">http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/</a> (3.5 Gigas !!!! I ended up downloading it to the old Mac and transfer it through USB). I chose not to install iOS Developer. A whooping 6Gigs uncompressed.</li>
	<li>Install MAcPorts</li>
	<li>Update Ruby on rails:
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install rails
sudo gem update installed</li>
	<li>Terminal setting. Close window on exit without errors. Homebrew theme by default.</li>
	<li>Terminal - case insensitive auto-complete. On Terminal type:
echo "set completion-ignore-case On" &gt;&gt; ~/.inputrc</li>
	<li>On Geektool I adapted ideas from the geeklets forum:</li>
</ul>
-A system log

-Network speed with this geeklet script
<blockquote># Change this to en0 for an ethernet connection instead of airport

INTF=en0

# get the current number of bytes in and bytes out

sample1=(`/usr/sbin/netstat -ib | awk "/$INTF/"'{print $7" "$10; exit}'`)

# wait one second

sleep 1

# get the number of bytes in and out one second later

sample2=(`/usr/sbin/netstat -ib | awk "/$INTF/"'{print $7" "$10; exit}'`)

# find the difference between bytes in and out during that one second

# and convert bytes to kilobytes

results=(`echo "2k ${sample2[0]} ${sample1[0]} - 1024 / p" "${sample2[1]} ${sample1[1]} - 1024 / p" | dc`)

# print the results

printf "In: %.2f Kb/secnOut: %.2f Kb/secn" ${results[0]} ${results[1]}</blockquote>
-Battery info. It tells when is fully charged, time to reach full charge, or remaining battery time. It also warns if Flash is running while on batteries.
<blockquote>isFullyCharged=`ioreg -n AppleSmartBattery | grep FullyCharged | awk '{ print $5 }'`

timeLeft=`ioreg -n AppleSmartBattery | grep TimeRemaining | awk '{ print $5 }'`

if [ $isFullyCharged = "Yes" ] ; then

echo "Battery charged."

else

((hour=$timeLeft/60))

((min=$timeLeft-$hour*60))

isConnected=`ioreg -n AppleSmartBattery | grep ExternalConnected | awk '{ print $5 }'`

if [ $isConnected = "No" ] ; then

flash=`ps aux | grep -c "Flash"`

test $flash = "2" &amp;&amp; printf "¡Flash on batteries! -&gt; DRAIN "

fi

printf " $hour:$min remaining"

fi</blockquote>
I´ll probably add more things, but these are the basics for me.
