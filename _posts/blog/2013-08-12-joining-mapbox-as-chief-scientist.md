I´ve joined [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com/) as [Chief Scientist](http://www.mapbox.com/about/team/#bruno-sánchez-andrade-nuño)! This is a long coming love story, possible thanks to my recent [*extraordinary* visa](/2013/07/22/alien-with-extraordinary-ability/). An amazing next stop on my journey to bridge Science and Technology with Society at large. I am very excited to join this awesome team.

Think of MapBox as a mix of Wikipedia for maps (leveraging the power of open data and crowds) and Apple style to master a product that is beautiful, fast and breaks beyond convention. Faster, better, open maps for anything that has a location. 

Opening the *geo* space... What is MapBox doing?

* A [cloudless Satellite map](http://www.wired.com/design/2013/05/a-cloudless-atlas/) of the whole world. 
* Maps provider for Github, Foursquare, Financial Time, Le Monde, USA Today, ... See [Showcase](http://www.mapbox.com/showcase/)
* Street level satellite image [fresh from space](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/super-sharp-pleiades-imagery-on-mapbox/) (this was my first blog post, on my first week here) .
* Monitoring [deforestation in the Amazonas](http://infoamazonia.org/maps/deforestation/).
* [Map of Mars](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/2012-08-26-mapping-mars/).
* [TileMill](), a free app to style your map data.
* An incredibly huge [code repository](https://github.com/mapbox), and guidelines to process your data using only open source software ([e.g.](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/super-sharp-pleiades-imagery-on-mapbox/)).
...

And this is just a sneak peak of what has already shipped in [less than 3 years](http://www.mapbox.com/about/). Btw, [we are hiring](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/jobs-at-mapbox/).


A real garage start-up... Well, a garage with glass doors that we open on summer days, couches, fossball, free food and drinks, computers hanging on the walls, a bar space, bike rack, meeting rooms that actually are *hanging out* rooms since there are virtually no meetings ...
