*Climate change is what we deserve* were the exact words I heard from an
otherwise well educated and reasonable scientist. The logic was something like:

    Climate has changed in the past. Yes there might a significant change
    lately but so has happened milenia ago, for natural reasons, like
    volcanos and other stuff. If you look at the long term climate, it´s
    full of variations. *Climate changes*

    Therefore this change, that is doubtfully due to humans, is not really
    worrysome. Climate changes and we have to deal with it. And if we are
    the cause of it, more so. Why fight against the consecuenes we deserve?.
    We are too many, we harm envionment too much. If we indeed are the cause and we
    dissapear due to climate change, it´s the natural thing. Like if we were a virus
    and Earth needs to heal.  The earth will come back into its equilibrium afterwards.

This logic comes from a highly educated person, doing basic research 
science. And the fact is this is not the first time I hear a
similar catastrophic argument of cosmic justice. On this particular case,
few others around the table agreed on it.

I was passionate to argue the validity of that logic, but besides trying to make 
the point of the flawed logic, it sent me an important message: 
The problem here is not the lack of information. The problem is inaction, and passivity, 
and our reasoning to get to the point we can justify that attitude.
Something like reverse logic, where you know which conclusion you want
to get, and you trace back why doing so make sense (sounds familiar?).

I managed to let her see that our lifestyle is the problem, 
we, in the developed world, pollute, but
those paying for it are others. The consequence of our actions are
suffered by others. That doesn't seem very *just*. This double inequality
of climate change is one of reasons for doing adaptation, specially in
the developing world: The ones
polluting the most are typically the ones suffering the least
consequences. The ones most aware tend to be the ones that can do the
least. 

Furthermore, polluting (carbon-based development) is 
an important factor to change to "the other side", to develop and economy and become more
resilient. This "right to pollute" is the core of the Kyoto Protocol. Those who
have benefited from that polluting phase want to avoid other to do the same and further
pollute the environment, so the idea is for the develop world to pay the
developing world for their missed opportunity to develop at the cost of
emissions, and thus help leap frog directly into the kind of green
development most develop world themselves has not reached yet. This is
done creating an artificial market of emissions, where countries trade
as they need. I won't
go into the Kyoto protocol here, but basically it doesn't work because
countries are not willing to sign it and enforce it, specially the ones
that would need to pay. Too much political and economical cost.
