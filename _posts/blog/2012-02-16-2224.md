title: Life is not just
---
<pre>Life is not always just, but no one said said it would.
We get sick, we grow older, we die.
Justice is social, no natural.
We make social laws, we can break social laws.
Gravity, magnetism, are natural laws, you can't break them.
Life doesn't care about justice,
just like there is no "unjust gravity".
So, you see, Life doesn't care about it. Life is natural.
So stand up, keep fighting, and be just, whatever it comes.</pre>
<p style="text-align:right;">Dedicated to those who always stand up,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">till they aren't.</p>
