<a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> published today an interview we made about the climate negotiations in Durban, South Africa. We discussed the importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">open data</a> in the climate mitigation and adaptation movements. <!--more-->The interview also highlights how the <a href="http://gain.globalai.org/">Global Adaptation Index</a> is a groundbreaking tool that utilizes open data to help countries adapt to climate change and other global forces:
<blockquote>Q: How do you see GAIN as a player in a potentially growing open data space around the maturing climate change conversation?

A: GAIN is already able to pinpoint where a country lies in the global context and navigate through its strong and weak points. However, it quickly becomes apparent that we do have frustrating limitations, like data gaps or heterogeneous quality. This means that GlobalAI is actually advocating for better data, frequently updated where it makes sense.

Furthermore, as climate change is a global challenge with local solutions, it also means that the current country level in GAIN should be improved into the regional or local level. But we simply don´t have the data. This is especially important for countries like Canada, Russia, and China where the effects of climate change vary dramatically inside the country. This is not optional - everyone seeking a data driven approach needs that data, those maps. We need to gather the data, to analyze it, and to mine it. The exciting thing is that we are already seeing cases using new approaches like crowdsourcing.</blockquote>
