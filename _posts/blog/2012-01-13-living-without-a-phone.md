title: Living without a phone
---
I decided to make little simple experiment: Try to live without my smart phone. Could we go back to that?

Why? Just to test how much mi lifestyle really depends on it. Also because T-Mobile <a href="http://www.moneytalksnews.com/2012/01/05/t-mobile-ditches-flexplay-%E2%80%93-how-it-affects-you/">drop</a> my contract type (FlexPay) and they only offered me to switch to a 2-year contract without any other incentive. Before buying a new one I wanted to try this out.

I don't have a landline, but I have Google Voice and that's the number I gave to most people. It used to ring my mobile, but also the office number during the workday and also Google Chat If I'm online. Also the door in my building rings the Google Voice, so I just need to keep my laptop online whenever I'm home to open the door (weird). I am always at the office or at home, so I should be pretty much covered and reachable.

Soon after I realized I am more relaxed. I walk on the street looking where I'm walking and the city, not staring on the little screen checking emails. Now I see how many people do that (easy 80% on the bus). I do check my email/facebook/... less often, which I like.

I had set the phone on airplane mode (to save battery as the phone kept trying to join the network). I carried it one or two days but soon I became useless as it only had data whenever I had Wifi. Those places are usually the office and home where I have a laptop or computer.

Then I missed it when:
<ul>
	<li>I went to meet someone and I had forgotten the address I was told via chat.</li>
	<li>At the dinner and we didn't know the difference between sushi and sashimi, and I could not look it up.</li>
	<li>I could not check how many free spots were available on BikeShare.</li>
	<li>I went running and I could not use Pandora.</li>
	<li>I could not tweet/upload a nice picture, or write down something quick to keep/share.</li>
	<li>I could not just call friends/family whenever I felt like it. I had to plan it.</li>
	<li>I could not find out which is the song they were playing at the bar.</li>
	<li>I missed calls/meetings because they changed the time or I forgot about them.</li>
	<li>I had to print a LivingSocial voucher instead of showing it on the mobile. Not very environmentally friendly.</li>
</ul>
I have a small Moleskine book, and I started to write more there. I like that. I also take the time on the bus to draw sketches. Or read books.

Then a friend told it wasn't fair cause I could call people on their mobiles, but they could not call me. True. So I stopped calling mobiles and used only landlines or email. Still I knew they would read their email on the mobile so I would try to send only emails at times they would use a computer and not a mobile.

The expectation of being reachable on a phone number is taken for granted. Specially among friends/family. It removes the barrier of physical distance. It's very important for your social life.

I had a phone around for a long visit I recently had. It was super cheap with pre-paid minutes. I linked it to Google Voice, but I barely used it. The reason is that I soon realized my lifestyle very much depends on access to information. Our phones might very well remove the call function, but removing the data is what I missed the most.

I do miss more my data connection that my voice service. Ironically, I have a Google Tv and don't have a cable or TV service. I only use the data connection to stream video via Amazon, Youtube or Netflix. I don't miss the TV (at all) but I would miss the data connection.

Data is coming to our lifestyles so swiftly we don't realize how much our standard of doing things depends on it.
