It is a great honor and pleasure to announce that I have been granted a Fellowship in Science Policy at the National Academies, in Washington DC. As anyone could tell by the topics of this blog, I am quite interested in Science and Technology, and its relation with Society. I regard Science Policy as the ultimate tool to articulate this relation at large. I am, thus, really looking forward this professional opportunity.  Just few more weeks, on the 30th of August.

The Fellowship, called "<a href="https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/policyfellows/index.htm">Mirzayan Science &amp; Technology Policy Graduate Fellowship Program</a>" is designed to engage its Fellows in the analytical process that informs U.S. science and technology policy. The host institution, the <a href="www.nationalacademies.org/">National Academies</a> is a corporation created under Lincoln´s mandate almost 150 years ago. Its members serve as "advisers to the nation on science, engineering, and medicine."

<!--more-->In particular I will be joining the <a href="https://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/index.htm">Space Studied Board</a>, helping in whichever way they deem most appropriate. Space falls closest to my research expertise, so we already know some ways I could collaborate with them. Space policy is truly an interesting topic that will draw increasing attention, as we get more benefits (and dependence) from a proper utilization of the space (scientific, commercial, strategic, economic, for development, ...). As I said, I am really looking forward August the 30th.
