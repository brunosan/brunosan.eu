What a year. 


###Introduced Google Glass to Rajoy, and half of Spain

###Visited Moncloa

With the YGL nomination and other work I was doing the head of President's cabinet  invited me to Moncloa. Demoing Glass to Rajoy and being in half of Spain newspapers and national radio at the moment probably helped. Truly an honor, but not much actionable. I wish I could collaborate more with my country.
