Going back to your high school and give a talk to the younger versions of yourself, running your first ultramarathon (54km in 6 h), waking up an Earthquake, 
visiting Mongolia and Greenland, catching up with life with old friends I had not seen in 5+ yeas, waking up to an im-promptu Skynews interview in pijamas, visiting Moncloa, meeting my president, crossing the Atlantic ocean
4 times in 3 weeks in first class to give talks and participate in meetings,

Also did my first sunrise run, 


###Introduced Google Glass to Rajoy, and half of Spain

###Visited Moncloa

With the YGL nomination and other work I was doing the head of President's cabinet  invited me to Moncloa. Demoing Glass to Rajoy and being in half of Spain newspapers and national radio at the moment probably helped. Truly an honor, but not much actionable. I wish I could collaborate more with my country.
