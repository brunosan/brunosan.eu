<p style="text-align:justify;">I am delighted to announce the availability of the "100 Hours of Astronomy Sidewalk Astronomy and Starparty Awards"Â <a href="https://www.video.rnp.br/overmedia/VisualizarVideo.do?_InstanceIdentifier=0&amp;_EntityIdentifier=rnpJi9ldP_k-5Rl0gdMV_7G9YYpaho6TA1SO4CYChdSBjU.">video</a> (1h53m streaming video). These awards were <a href="https://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/component/content/article/34-site-navigation/253-award-winners">granted</a> to outsanding participants participating inside the <a href="https://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/">100 Hours of Astronom</a>y, part of International Year of Astronomy 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am part of the organizing team and the judge committee, so I am extremely happy to be able to help provide some prizes. I present in the video the Award number 4, halfway down into the video, with my handheld camera...</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This kind of activities are only possible with the voluntary help of many people. People who also belive on the idea of "<a href="https://www.astronomy2009.org/">The Universe, yours to discover</a>". The outcome is of great value and we put a <strong>lot</strong> of effort and time to prepare it, but all that is wet paper without the help of all <a href="https://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/component/eventlist/eventsmap">these</a> people, all around the world. We were a historical success, but only because of you, <strong>thank you</strong>. I wish we had awards for everyone!.</p>
