(Notice: I was given this book for free with the condition of reviewing it on my
blog.)

This book is disappointing and I do not recommend it.
It seems an uncomprehensive recollection of examples with no real 
insights. His approach is shallow and naive (perhaps
intentionally so). Yet, it provides interesting pointers to research
elsewhere.
The Wikipedia entry on [Cyberwarfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare) is far more relevant and
updated.

There are many typos, the density of content is very low, and the style
seems more appropriate for a blog, not an O-Reilly book. At times it
resembles an speculative conspiracy plot. This book is not technical,
neither I would qualify it as a good policy brief. For a good policy
overview for the USA I would recommend the (free) NAS report on 
[Deterring
Cyberattacks](https://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12997).


Cyberwarfare moves in the forefront of technology. As technologies
mainstream and reach exponentially larger audiences, the leading edge
gets very advanced and diverse. 
I chose this title looking for a technical overview of the topic, some historical
examples and an evaluation of where the topic is evolving into.


The author, Jeffrey Carr, is the CEO of [Taia
Global](https://www.taiaglobal.com/), "a cyber
intelligence expert and consultant".


It does have a few interesting description of events, 
policy implications and issues that make very good pointers to discuss,
learn or research upon (outside this book). Interestingly I would recommend
this book exactly as that, a conversation starter for the Issues and
facts, not for the conclusions or narrative. 

Looking at the Index I hope to make the point that the book does cover
appropriate topics, but it fails to provide a structure or sense of
comprehension.
