title: Create, and remember, unique secure passwords
---
All of us have logins in many different pages. Only within the last month, my computer tracked 52 cases where I asked my browser to remember my password.

The problem is that most people use the very same password everywhere. And that poses a great security risk. Once someone knows your password, they can jump straight to your Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn, ... Think, a cracker just needs to create a simple web app and ask you to sign up.

I do have a different complex password for every page I login. And I never forget any. This is my simple way to do it.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/screen-shot-2011-01-10-at-16-05-14.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1300" title="Screen shot 2011-01-10 at 16.05.14" src="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/screen-shot-2011-01-10-at-16-05-14.png?w=500" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hacking your passwords system:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Decide a common part. Something with more than 4 characters. For example, a common word, but repeating a character (it makes it easier for the brain to remember, and it will disorient dicctionary attacks). For example: <strong>elephhant
</strong></li>
	<li>Decide a common symbol to use. For example this "<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>%</strong></span>". Do not use very uncommon ones or you won´t find it on foreign keyboards. Sandwich your word with it: <strong>%elephhant%
</strong></li>
	<li>Here´s the simple twist. Use a letter of the web address you are in. Say I choose the second. In www.facebook.com it would be "a". In www.gmail.com would be "m". Uppercase it and choose where to put it. I choose on the end. That leads to my set of secure, different passwords. For example:
in www.facebook.com:<strong> %elephhant%A</strong>
in www.blabla.com: <strong>%elephhant%L</strong>
in wordpress.com: <strong>%elphhant%O</strong></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;line-height:24px;font-size:16px;">With this simple trick, you´ll avoid repeating the password, while enforcing a much higher security practice. If someone sneaks your password, they won´t be able to access other sites.</span>

Last advice, once you decide your scheme, keep it, and change your password on every page you already use.

<strong>Extra step</strong>: Buy a domain and add it to <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html">Google Apps</a>. Then set it up to redirect all email directions to your main one. Then use the url as the user name for each service as login (e.g. facebook@brunosan.eu, linkedin@brunosan.eu, meneame@brunosan.eu). This way you can trace also if the service gave your info to anyone.

...and when you explain your trick to friends, change your choices ;)
