"It is not about the Science, it is not about mitigation, it is not about
projections... itÂ´s about the adaptation gap". This is what I was
thinking as I left the NAS/NASA workshop [*Walkign the talk: Climate
Science in Service to Resilient Fedearl Properties*](#).

This workshop was canceled few hours short of its original date, ##, due
to Sandy. On the second attempt, it was again almost cancelled, due to
exceptional wind and rain conditions in DC.
