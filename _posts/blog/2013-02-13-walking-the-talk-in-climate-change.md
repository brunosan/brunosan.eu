>"It is not about the Science, it is not about mitigation, it is not about projections... it´s about all of that, on top of the **current** adaptation gap". 

This is what I was
thinking as I left the NAS/NASA workshop [*Walking the talk: Climate
Science in Service to Resilient Federal
Properties*](https://www.tisp.org/index.cfm?cdid=12848&pid=10231).

This workshop, incidentally, was canceled few hours short of its original date, October 31st, due
to [Sandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy#Mid-Atlantic_2). On the second attempt, it was again almost cancelled, due to
[exceptional wind and rain conditions in DC](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:V9J9gTKsRpoJ:forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php%3Fwarnzone%3DVAZ042%26warncounty%3DVAC107%26local_place1%3DBluemont%252BVA%26product1%3DWind%2BAdvisory+&cd=7&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). That pretty much summarizes
my take-away from the meeting.

NASA, as a forerunner, shared their progress
securing their federal facilities against the changing climate. They talked about the process from
the science of data and models, to the implementation of adaptation measures such as
physical storm surge barriers at their coastal rocket facilities.

I found of special relevance the importance they gave to avoid a purely science driven
approach. It´s just not only about the science pushing data to decision
makers. Indeed, NASA partnered with architects, contractors, journalists and other
stakeholders with the goal of being responsive to all actors involved on
this process.

Still, the disconnect exists. Even on a room filled with federal
employees whose boss in 2009 established a presidential [Climate change Adaptation Task
Force](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq/initiatives/adaptation) (along with the mandate to "manage the effects of climate change in short and long term"), 
as well as concrete [2011 Implementing Instructions for Federal Agency Climate Change Adaptation Planning](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ceq/adaptation_final_implementing_instructions_3_3.pdf).
 One of the first question from another
federal employee was about the uncertainty of climate science. To him,
inaction was wiser until we know to *what* we should adapt *to*.
And so we debated and polarized even more the issue.

Where is this disconnect coming from? Part of this, I believe, is that
climate change is linked to mitigation and *future* consequences. The future overshadows the present. For example, sea level rise is present on every
discussion on climate change, while storm surges are often not so. Yet these [already have costly
consequences](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-to-protect-new-york-city-from-storm-surges). Perhaps
we´ll see this loop closing as people connect with the unfortunate,
reality of increasing extreme events like storm surges,
[droughts](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/),
blizzards... Here at home, not overseas on the TV. As we connect  with our *current* climate
vulnerability: There is already an **adaptation gap** that needs to be
addressed. Building resiliency, protecting lives, saving ecosystems, safeguarding livelihoods,
protecting investments and infrastructures, identifying new
opportunities and challenges. This, in turn, will unleash an inclusive role of all stakeholders, including 
the underplayed private sector.

Of course, on top of this current vulnerability, challenges will increase,
specially for the most vulnerable. 

Perhaps americans, as constituency, will *connect* with the climate and thus push it up on the
political agenda. Perhaps then political leadership will catalyze. For
that, a second term president certainly helps.

Treating climate change as a mitigation issue with incremental impacts in the future is ill-informed. Manhattan probably has the greenest least polluting modern buildings, and yet it
will continue to flood until we take action on building resilience to
climate.
