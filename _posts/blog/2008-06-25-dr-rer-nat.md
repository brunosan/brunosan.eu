So, finally, almost 5 months after my <a href="/2008/02/18/defensa-de-la-tesis/">dissertation</a>, I have just 
ended all paperwork, bureaucracy, published the book of the thesis, ... and just got **it**:

From now on, for the rest of my life, I hold the title of "Dr. rer. nat." which stands for *Doctor rerum naturalis* ( Doctor of
 natural things).

I am so happy :D<

PD: and now back to life. 
Like the t-shirt I got at my graduation party: "PhD, Looking for a job"
