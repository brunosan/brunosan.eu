title: Fasting for 3 days
published: true 
---

After reading for a few days about it, and collecting some facts, I
decided to overcome my cultural fear and fast for 3 full days and
nights. Only water, avoiding exercise and seeing how it feels.

Your body has an extraordinary array of [alternative pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_response) to get it´s energy. This is a evolutionary advantage to survive starvation longer, while keeping cognitive function and mobility.  The main mechanism is 
glucose (25% of it for your brain, which gets preference always). Glucose from sugars, carbohydrates, or stored as glycogen in your liver and muscles. After
~10h of no eating (or 2 running) you deplete your reserves. Then the
body breaks down fat reserves into glycerol that is then converted into
glucose. The liver also ramps us conversion of fatty acids for energy,
which produces keton bodies that can be used by all organs, including
the brain. (One of the byproducts is acetone which is released by breath
and urine.) After a several days, the cells start to break down muscle
tissue to get the aminoacids that can be converted into glucose. I do not know, however, what happens with the rest, like vitamins, electrolytes, minerals, ... or the vital bacteria on our intestines.

Fasting also changes the mind. Some of the coping and metabolic mechanisms trigger
mood changing drugs like gluco-corticoids, epinephrine, catecholamine ...
Fasting can also help migraines, epilepsia, anxiety, depression... This is
both accounted in [historical
texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction#History),
[research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23332541) and the fact
that many cultures and
[religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting#Religious_views)
include fasting as a holy practice.

(Limited) research as also shows
[[e.g.]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440038) that on rats and
humans, fasting, and intermittent fasting in particular, is correlated
with less oxidative damage and inflammation, optimized energy metabolism, lenghtening lifespan, protection against diabetes, cancers, heart disease, neurodegeneration, reduce obesity, hypertension, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis.

I don´t know where the healthy point is, but is probably closer to
calorie reduction or intermittent fasting, than it is to eggs and bacon for
breakfast and Chipotle for lunch.

In my experience, at first it felt normal, just a bit hungry after I
missed my breakfast and lunch. Just water whenever I felt like drinking.
Then I, stopped feeling hungry, and I felt a little bit dizzy, weak, so I avoided exercise. But fine
mentally and in good mood. After 2 days I sometimes felt "emtpy" on the
stomach, or a tingling sensation in the muscles, heart beating a little
faster for a while, but nothing worrying. I went for a 2 hours walk and chat with a friend. Not sure if true, but I felt
my senses more acute, my sense of smell and hearing in particular. The
people I talked to didn´t notice anything if I didn´t tell them. 

I feel I could have lasted more than 3 days, I didn´t have urge to eat (which doesn´t make evolutionary sense), but for a first experience seems enough exploration in unknown territories. Some people told me they fasted for 7 days. It´s good to get to
know your body and where you can safely take it, but 3 days seems enough for a while.
