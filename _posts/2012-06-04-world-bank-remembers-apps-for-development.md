title: World Bank remembers Apps for Development
---
I can´t stress enough how <strong>grateful</strong> and <strong>honored</strong> our team feels for being one of the winning apps. One year after we can quite get over the idea how fun and rewarding was the whole experience. Yet, I feels there is B side to this story that doesn´t get much attention. And it can be fixed. I´ve been thinking about it for a while, and we even talked about this other entrants to the same competition, winners and "loosers".

Here´s the problem. When you call for a competition, you´ll (hopefully) get more entrants than prizes. You reward the best ones but ... what you do with <em>The Rest</em>?

The Rest likely joined the competition motivated by

you backslashing the long term. All those non winners will loose the motivation

<strong>Apps for Development winners one year later</strong>

The competition complemented the Bank’s </span><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">Open Data initiative</span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, and encouraged non-traditional audiences to use the Bank’s datasets.</span></span>

Still, the question that dogs most apps competitions is “So what?” What happens after the awards ceremony and photo op? Where do the software developers go from here? Have they been able to scale their applications’ use to a wider audience?

<!--more-->“The most valuable part of being recognized as one of the winners is the 'stamp of approval' of the World Bank, which gives other organizations confidence in using the application for their own purposes,” said first prize winner Frank van Cappelle, a PhD student at the University of Melbourne.

Van Cappelle’s app, <a href="http://www.statsilk.com/maps/statplanet-world-bank-open-data" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">StatPlanet</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">—which helps users explore more than 3,000 Bank economic indicators with interactive maps and graphics—was customized soon after to visualize country, regional and global performance data on 19 key education indicators, released under the name </span><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/node/647" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">EdStats</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"> by the Bank’s Human Development Network. Paid customizations of StatPlanet are also under way for several organizations who wish to modify the app to better suit their purposes, including the International Food Policy Research Institute and the UN MDG GAP Task Force.</span><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:xx-small;">
</span>

<span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><img class=" wp-image-2344 alignleft" title="14006008" src="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/14006008.gif?w=156" alt="" width="156" height="300" />
Similarly, the competition served as a launch-pad for Athman Mohamed of Kenya, who created <a href="http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com/submissions/665-factcha-stop-spam-advocate-for-the-mdgs" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">FACTCHA</span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, an app that turns the few seconds Internet users spend to verify themselves as humans (e.g., secure id boxes) into time spent raising awareness about the MDGs. Rather than typing random words and phrases, FACTCHA-users are quizzed on their knowledge of the MDGs. Since the competition, Mohamed served as the technology lead for the </span><a href="http://opendata.go.ke/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">Kenya Open Data Initiative</span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, which successfully put Kenya on the global map as one of the first countries in the developing world to open up their government data. After receiving a commendation from the Ministry of Information for his efforts, Mohamed now serves as director of ICT for Trade and Transport Facilitation at a $400 million non-for-profit trust where he previously served in management.</span>Spaniard Dr. Bruno Sánchez-Andrade Nuño was a finalist for the app </span><a href="http://www.quiz2015.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Know Your World</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, an interactive quiz of 17,000 questions fueled by Bank data about the Millennium Development Goals. Sánchez believes his participation in the competition led to a leap in his professional career: he is now the director of Science and Technology at the Global Adaptation Institute, where he works with data and development issues.</span>

The competition also benefited the Bank in unexpected ways. Allowing unfettered access to the Bank’s treasure trove of data helped Bank staff uncover issues in the datasets and technical glitches that otherwise would not have been discovered so quickly. The ability to correct these issues as they arose bettered the quality of the data and the ability to access it with ease. It was a win-win situation.

<span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">The reach of Apps for Development was striking. In the six months leading up to the deadline more than 80,000 visitors from 200 countries visited the </span><a href="http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">website</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">. Software developers from 36 countries entered more than 100 software applications, which ranged from data visualizations to mobile apps. More than half were submitted from </span><a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22823055~menuPK:34457~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Africa</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">, Asia, and Latin America. In fact, Africa was the region with the most submissions overall.</span>

With Apps for Development receiving such a tremendous response, the World Bank Institute’s <a href="http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/approach/innovation" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Innovation Practice</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"> is now developing a </span><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/challenge" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">World Bank Challenge platform </span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;">to institutionalize the process and to support a wide variety of competitions. Indeed, the </span><a href="http://intranet.worldbank.org/WBSITE/INTRANET/INTRANETHOME/0,,contentMDK:23061893~menuPK:64140059~pagePK:6426483~piPK:6402841~theSitePK:86048,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Apps for Climate</span></span></a><span style="font-family:serif;font-size:medium;"> competition was launched in December during the United Nations Climate Summit in Durban, South Africa. Surely, this is just the beginning.
