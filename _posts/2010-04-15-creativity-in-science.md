title: Creativity in Science
---
Some days ago, a friend interviewed me about creativity and science. She is doing a Masters in Malta and she wanted my opinion on certain questions. It turned out to be a very interesting conversation. This was all part of a wider report. Once she finished it, if she agrees, I´ll post it here as well. For now, I am posting her main questions.
