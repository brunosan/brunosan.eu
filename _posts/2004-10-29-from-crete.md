title: From CRETE!
---
I am writing from the Physics Library of the Crete University, at Heraklion. Crete is really beautiful.. and Hot (HOT) place now &gt;D We will spend here 4 more days and then 2 to Athens. We went to the historical museum of the city, Great! and also to a city tour, party at disco, ... Everything is perfect... but only that I do NOT understand A WORD, amazing. For our coming we used the Olympus Palace boat, with like 9 floors, disco, supermarket, cinema, ... I am really having a great time here, ok, but without sleeping...Just 30 minutes ago I got slept at the urban bus... and it was only a 10 minutes trip!!!
<br />Some small pieces: no one uses helmet with the motos, the city is a mess, the gyros pita (like kebabs) are quite cheap with the drinks and specially coffee are really expensive, also drinks (one drink at a disco 7 euros!)... People don't pay anything for university and any student has the meal for free, ...
