title: From CRETE!
---
I am writing from the Physics Library of the Crete University, at Heraklion. Crete is really beautiful.. and a Hot (HOT) place. We will spend here 4 more days and then 2 in Athens. We went to the historical museum of the city. It was great! and also to a city tour, party at disco, ... Everything is perfect... but only that I donÂ´t understand A WORD they say, amazing. To get here we used the Olympus Palace boat, with like 9 floors, disco, supermarket, cinema, ... I am really having a great time here... but without sleeping...Just 30 minutes ago I felt sleep at the urban bus... and it was only a 10 minutes ride!!!
<br />Some small pieces: nobody uses helmet riding their motorbikes, the city is a mess, the gyros pita (like kebabs) are quite cheap, coffee is really expensive, also drinks at pubs (one drink at a disco, 7 euros!)... People don't pay anything for university and any student has the meals for free, ...
