I´m in the progress of moving my blog into Jekyll. I´m halfway done, so I´ve decided to publish the new version.

Sorry if things are broken. I´ve tried to respect the URL to the posts,
so most inbound links should still work.

My old site still lives at [Wordpress](http://nasonurb.wordpress.com).

Feel free to send me your comments to [brunosan@gmail.com](mailto:brunosan@gmail.com?subject=Feedback for your newsite). Thanks!
