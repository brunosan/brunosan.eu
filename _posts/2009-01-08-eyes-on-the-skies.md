The <em><a href="http://www.eyesontheskies.org/movie.php">Eyes on the Skies</a></em> is an astronomical education movie (there is also a book). It is freely available to TV broadcasters (<a href="mailto:lars@eso.org">contact them</a> for further information)." It explores the many facets of the telescope — the historical development, the scientific importance, the technological breakthroughs, and also the people behind this ground-breaking invention, their triumphs and failures".

It is presented by <em>Dr. J,</em> aka Dr. Joe Liske, a professional astronomer from the <a href="http://www.eso.org/" target="_blank">European Southern Observatory</a> and host of the <em>Hubblecast</em> video podcast. The DVD runs for 60 minutes and contains subtitles in several languages, including spanish.

I am somehow involved, since I took part on the localization into spanish (Look at the credits).

I highly recommend the movie.I find it very well designed and produced. If you a a TV channel contact them for free broadcast. If you are an educator or amateur astronomer I highly recommend you to see it.  You can also buy it <a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/goodies/cdroms/html/eyes_cb_sd_cover.html">on the Hubble shop. </a> Material form that page has little cost for consumers, and it is <a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/hubbleshop/webshop/webshop.php?show=free&amp;section=brochures">free</a> for members of the press, educators and observatory/planetarium/museum guides. Also, according to (at least) spanish regulations, you could also download it for free from P2P networks for personal use.

The authors gave me, for my contribution, a small number of copies for free (Thank you) that I am willing to distribute. I am particularly interested in sending them to school or astronomical educational associations. Please contact me to arrange the mailing. Better if I could send you some ~10 copies and you re-distribute it.
