title: Supreme arrogance
---
<pre>"The supreme arrogance of religious thinking: 
that a carbon-based bag of mostly water 
on a speck of iron-silicate dust 
around a boring dwarf star 
in a minor galaxy 
in an underpopulated local group of galaxies 
in an unfashionable suburb of a super-cluster 
would look up at the sky and declare, 
‘It was all made so I could exist!’"
</pre>
