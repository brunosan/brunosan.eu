I chose this title looking for an overview of the topic, some historical
examples and an evaluation of where the topic is evolving into.

I respect authors very much. Pullign together any book takes times,
energy and a lot of thought, specially with such an aim to provide an
overview of a field that evolves so fast and ties with so many areas of
technology, policy and security.


Lewis Shepherd, CTO from Microsoft Institute for Advanced Technology in
Goverments even says, right on the cover, "The necessary handbook for
the 21st century".

##Change!
I fundamentally disagree with his approach to information assurance and
what constitutes cyber warfare, and he's a bit too naive (perhaps
intentionally so)

Boring, unstructured and full of crap. This is the kind of person that
gives security people a bad name.
