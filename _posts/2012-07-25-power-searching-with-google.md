Just got the certificate for my participation in [Power Searching
with
Google](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/powersearching.html). (Free and online)

* Mid-class assessment score:  100%
* Post-class assessment score:  100%

I have to say that I've enjoyed it, but most of what is covered seems a bit basic. If Google decided to this course it means that it is not common knowledge, which is already interesting feedback. Things like search by filetype, by image, only inside a site, ...
They did cover a few tips I did not know, like *intext:* or searches that translate pages, but IÂ´m
not sure it made the whole time invested worth. I ended up jumping to the assessments, and from
the errors, go back to the indicated lesson.

The course material seems closed only to registered folks, but
[Carolin](http://www.twitter.com/bumsonseats) compiled the
[links to all the
videos](http://bumsonseats.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/power-searching-with-google-2/).


They also did a Hangout. Just like the course, there is a very thin line
between what you know and you want to skip, and what you don't know.

Interesting how they agree, on the video,  that [Google Instant](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/instant/about.html) killed the *I'm feeling
lucky* button, and the only time it works is to click with an empty search
term, which leads to the [Google
Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/finder/2012/All%20doodles) page (...)

For what is worth, I can say Google agrees I know how to search it.
