Just got the certificate for my participation in [Power Searching
with
Google](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/powersearching.html). 

* Mid-class assessment score:  100%
* Post-class assessment score:  100%

And, as for my assesment, 90% of what is covered, I knew already. Things like filetype, search by image, search inside a site, ...
The things I didn't know (like *intext:* or searches translated pages) are useful, but IÂ´m
not sure worth the time. I ended up jumping to the assessments, and from
the errors, go back to the indicated lesson.

The course seems close to registered folks, but
[Carolin](http://www.twitter.com/bumsonseats) compiled the
[links to all the
videos](http://bumsonseats.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/power-searching-with-google-2/).


They did a Hangout. Just like the course, there is a very thin line
between what you know and you want to skip, and what you don't know.

Interesting how they agree, on the video,  that [Google Instant](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/instant/about.html) killed the *I'm feeling
lucky* button, and the only time it works is to click with an empty search
term, which leads to the [Google
Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/finder/2012/All%20doodles) page (...)

For what is worth, I can say Google agrees I know how to search it.
