Increasingly often, I find myself blinded by this thought. I look around where I am, the people around me, and I think: When did we decide to close or eyes to the awe of the Universe, to the beauty of all that we know about it? Since when are we so detached of the Earth as our home to respect and take care of? When did we become so detached of our fellow humans? I look around and I see artificiality, greed, dispassion, uninterested, desire for basic and short-term satisfaction.
