title: Why electricsuppliesonline.com is a big NONO
---
<div>I buy a nice CM11A X10 thing from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.electricsuppliesonline.com/x10procmcoin.html">electricsuppliesonline.com/</a></div><br /><div><br></div><div>I pay it with&nbsp;<a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=Ag54zsqDNDGXhaZG5d1QMtkbFt0A?p=electricsuppliesonline.com&amp;mid=1008240">Yahoo Shop</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>. All nice.</div><div><br></div><div>2 days later I get that <b>they don't actually have, neither can order it</b>. And they offer me <b>to pay twice the price</b> for a similar one.</div><div><br></div><div>So I say that that is unfair, and I believe they should updated their webpage and send me a similar (not worse) product of the one I bought (and actually can&nbsp;<a href="http://www.electricsuppliesonline.com/x10procmcoin.html">still buy</a>).</div><div><br></div><div>....and they say that it a systems fault (YOUR system, I don't care). They are <b>not able to change their web</b>. So they still appear in&nbsp;<a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AvWlrxs1ovrQkOAUbUCaOP8bFt0A?p=cm11a&amp;did=">Yahoo</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/products?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=cm11a&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=OMDgSr6sCIef8Aaq26xa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQrQQwAw">Google</a>, ... and that they still offer the more expensive alternative <b>only If I pay</b> the difference...&nbsp;</div><div>The best part, they say that <b>they don't actually have the more expensive alternative</b> they are asking me to pay.</div><div><br></div><div>you gotta be kidding&nbsp;<a href="http://www.electricsuppliesonline.com/x10procmcoin.html">electricsuppliesonline</a>&nbsp;...</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Of course I <b>cancel the order</b>, but I should fight for businesses like one you think you have, that destroy the trust in online shopping.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br /><a href="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/picture61.png"><img src="http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/picture61.png?w=292" border="0" /></a><br /><br />PD&gt; Yes, I am aware this is my second complain post on the blog...
