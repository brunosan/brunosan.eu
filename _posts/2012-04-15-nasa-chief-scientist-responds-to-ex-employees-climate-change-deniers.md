<em>Reblogged from <a href="http://slashdot.org/submission/2022621/nasa-chief-scientist-responds-to-ex-employees?utm_source=rss1.0&amp;utm_medium=feed">Slashdot</a>. Emphasis added:</em>

Last week a fellow at the Heartland Institute, a group <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/02/15/1515208/leaked-heartland-institute-documents-reveal-opposition-to-science" rel="nofollow">now notorious for their plan to subvert public science education</a>, gathered a coalition of 49 ex-NASA employees to <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/12/04/12/176200/ex-nasa-employees-accuse-agency-of-extreme-position-on-climate-change" rel="nofollow">sign a petition</a> urging NASA to reconsider its position on climate change. For perspective, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/13/nasa-climate-change-denier-stunts_n_1424492.html?ref=mostpopular" rel="nofollow">NASA currently employes over 18,000 people</a>, and there are likely tens of thousands of ex-employees. In their letter the group requested that NASA refrain from publishing unproven remarks. Since no theory can ever be considered proven, this appears to be an attempt to silence discussion. NASA Chief Scientist Waleed Abdalati <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36679" rel="nofollow">has since responded</a>:
<blockquote><em>Our Earth science programs provide many unique space-based observations and research capabilities to the scientific community to inform investigations into climate change... After these studies have met the appropriate standards of scientific peer-review, we strongly encourage scientists to communicate these results to the public. <strong>If the authors of this letter disagree with specific scientific conclusions</strong> made public by NASA scientists,<strong> we encourage them to join the debate in the scientific literature or public forums rather than restrict any discourse</strong>.</em></blockquote>
