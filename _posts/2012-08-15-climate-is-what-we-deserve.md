*Climate change is what we deserve* were the exact words I heard from a
well educated scientist. The logic was something on this line:

  Climate has changed in the past. Yes there is a significant change
lately but so has happened milenia ago, for natural reasons, like
volcanos and other things. If you look at the long term climate, it´s
full of variations.

  Therefore this change, that is doubtfully due to humans, is not really
worrysome. Climate changes and we have to deal with it. And if we are
the cause of it, more so. Why fight against the consecuenes we deserve.
We are too many, we harm envionment to much. If we are the cause and we
dissapear due to climate change, it´s the natural thing. The earth would
come back to its equilibrium afterwards.

This logic comes from a highly educated person, doing basic research 
science. And the fact is that this is not the first time I here a
similar catastrophysitc argument of cosmis justice. As a matter of fact,
few others around the table agreeded on it.

I was passionate to argue that, but besides trying to make the point of
the flawed logic, it sends an importante message. We seem to agree that
the inaction, or pasitive is the most common atitude against climate.
