I get this question often:

> What do you think about during those [long runs](http://www.strava.com/activities/29711259/overview)? Aren´t you bored,
> running so long?

I don´t know what I think, just like I don´t know what I talk about when
I meet someone *before* I meet them.

But reflecting back, It´s a mixture, sometimes I listen
to music, and that has the effect of switching off your thoughts, and
just let time pass with the mood modulated by the music.

Sometimes I use running time to think about an important meeting I´ll
have, or a blog post (e.g. this post), or ideas for a presentation, or
think about my goals or something that worries me. Or something that
just passed and I feel I handled it poorly. Since I am
 also running it´s great because I´m not
obsessing with the thoughts but mixing them with the place I run
through, the water or food I need to take, the people I pass by. It´s a
good combination of concentration without obsessive thinking.

Sometimes I just let the mind wonder. This is probably my favorite. I
just think how lucky I am for being fit, for having time to run, for
having endurance to run 3 hours and enjoying it. I reflect on my
surroundings, the nature, the river... the deer that escapes fro me, the biker,
the fellow runner ahead of me that I challenge myself to catch up... I fool myself
thinking that every other runner or biker I
see is also training for the same race.

I have learnt to also spend time "listening to my body". You don´t want to go too fast to enter
into [anaerobic regime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise), neither too slow. I have pretty much learnt
the feeling of riding the upper zone of aerobic regime by listening to the heart, to the breathing. Concentrating on the overall feeling... I also pay attention to the legs, check if there is any pain, if the stride is
ok... remembering to run *smoothly*, easy, with smallish strides, avoiding heel strike but also avoiding
overstraining the calfs.

Long runs take a **lot** of time. Not only the running time itself, but also the preparation going to bed early, pasta dinner, wake-up rutine, post-run shower and lunch, ... It can easily take the most of one weekend day
