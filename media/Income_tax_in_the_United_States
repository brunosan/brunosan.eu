<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, a <b>tax</b> is imposed on <b><a href="/wiki/Income" title="Income">income</a></b> by the Federal, most states, and many local governments. The <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income tax</a> is determined by applying a tax rate, which <a href="/wiki/Progressive_tax" title="Progressive tax">may increase as income increases</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Taxable_income" title="Taxable income">taxable income</a> as defined. Individuals and corporations are directly taxable, and estates and trusts may be taxable on undistributed income.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Partnership_taxation_in_the_United_States" title="Partnership taxation in the United States">Partnerships</a> are not taxed, but their partners are taxed on their shares of partnership income. Residents and citizens are taxed on worldwide income, while nonresidents are taxed only on income within the jurisdiction. Several types of credits reduce tax, and some types of credits may exceed tax before credits. An alternative tax applies at the Federal and some state levels.</p>
<p>Taxable income is total income less allowable <a href="/wiki/Tax_deduction" title="Tax deduction">deductions</a>. Income is broadly defined. Most business expenses are deductible. Individuals may also deduct a personal allowance (exemption) and certain personal expenses, including home mortgage interest, state taxes, contributions to charity, and some other items. Some deductions are subject to limits.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States" title="Capital gains tax in the United States">Capital gains</a> are fully taxable, and capital losses reduce taxable income only to the extent of gains. Individuals currently pay a lower rate of tax on capital gains and certain corporate dividends.</p>
<p>Taxpayers generally must self assess income tax by filing tax returns. Advance payments of tax are required in the form of withholding tax or estimated tax payments. Taxes are determined separately by each jurisdiction imposing tax. Due dates and other administrative procedures vary by jurisdiction. April 15 following the tax year is the due date for individual returns for Federal and many state and local returns. Tax as determined by the taxpayer may be adjusted by the taxing jurisdiction.</p>

Total tax revenue (not adjusted for inflation) for the U.S. Federal government from 1980 to 2009 compared to the amount of revenue coming from individual income taxes.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A tax is imposed on net <a href="/wiki/Taxable_income" title="Taxable income">taxable income</a> in the United States by the Federal, most state, and some local governments.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Income tax is imposed on individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts. The definition of net taxable income for most sub-federal jurisdictions mostly follows the Federal definition.</p>
<p>The rate of tax at the federal level is graduated; that is, the tax rates of higher amounts of income are higher than on lower amounts. The lower rate on lower income was phased out at higher incomes prior to 2010. Some states and localities impose an income tax at a graduated rate, and some at a flat rate on all taxable income. Federal tax rates in 2009 varied from 10% to 35%.</p>
<p>From 2003 through 2011, individuals were eligible for a reduced rate of Federal income tax on capital gains and qualifying dividends. The tax rate and some deductions are different for individuals depending on filing status. Married individuals may compute tax as a couple or separately. Single individuals may be eligible for reduced tax rates if they are head of a household in which they live with a dependent.</p>
<p>Federal <b>taxable income</b> is defined in a comprehensive manner in the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code" title="Internal Revenue Code">Internal Revenue Code</a> and regulations<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> issued by the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. Taxable income is <a href="/wiki/Gross_income" title="Gross income">gross income</a> as adjusted minus <a href="/wiki/Tax_deduction" title="Tax deduction">tax deductions</a>. Most states and localities follow this definition at least in part, though some make adjustments to determine income taxed in that jurisdiction. Taxable income for a company or business may not be the same as its book income.</p>
<p><b>Gross income</b> includes all income earned or received from whatever source. This includes salaries and wages, tips, pensions, fees earned for services, price of goods sold, other business income, gains on sale of other property, rents received, interest and <a href="/wiki/Dividend" title="Dividend">dividends</a> received, alimony received, proceeds from selling crops, and many other types of income. Some income, however, is <a href="/wiki/Tax_exemption" title="Tax exemption">exempt from income tax</a>. This includes interest on municipal bonds.</p>
<p><b>Adjustments</b> (usually reductions) to gross income of individuals are made for alimony paid, contributions to many types of retirement or health savings plans, certain student loan interest, half of self employment tax, and a few other items. The <a href="/wiki/Cost_of_goods_sold" title="Cost of goods sold">cost of goods sold</a> in a business is a direct reduction of gross income.</p>
<p>Taxable income of all taxpayers is reduced by <a href="/wiki/Tax_deductions" title="Tax deductions" class="mw-redirect">tax deductions</a> for expenses related to their <b>business</b>. These include salaries, rent, and other business expenses paid or accrued, as well as allowances for <a href="/wiki/MACRS" title="MACRS">depreciation</a>. The deduction of expenses may result in a loss. Generally, such loss can reduce other taxable income, subject to some limits.</p>
<p>Individuals are allowed several nonbusiness <b>deductions</b>. A flat amount per person is allowed as a deduction for <a href="/wiki/Personal_exemption_(United_States)" title="Personal exemption (United States)">personal exemptions</a>. For 2009 this amount was $3,650. Each taxpayer is allowed one such deduction for themselves and one for each person they support.</p>
<p>In addition, individuals get a deduction from taxable income for certain personal expenses. Alternatively, the individual may claim a <a href="/wiki/Standard_deduction" title="Standard deduction">standard deduction</a>. For 2011, the <b>standard deduction</b> is $5,800 for single individuals, $11,600 for a married couple, and $8,500 for a head of household. Those who choose to claim actual <b>itemized deductions</b> may deduct the following, subject to many conditions and limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income,</li>
<li>State, local, and foreign taxes,</li>
<li>Home mortgage interest,</li>
<li>Contributions to charities,</li>
<li>Losses on nonbusiness property due to casualty, and</li>
<li>Deductions for expenses incurred in the production of income in excess of 2% of adjusted gross income.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States" title="Capital gains tax in the United States">Capital gains</a></b> and <a href="/wiki/Qualified_dividend" title="Qualified dividend">qualified dividends</a> may be taxed as part of taxable income. However, the tax is limited to a lower tax rate. Capital gains include gains on selling stocks and bonds, real estate, and other capital assets. The gain is the excess of the proceeds over the adjusted basis (cost less depreciation deductions allowed) of the property. This limit on tax also applies to dividends from U.S. corporations and many foreign corporations. There are limits on how much net capital loss may reduce other taxable income.</p>
<p>All taxpayers are allowed a <a href="/wiki/Tax_credit" title="Tax credit">tax credit</a> for foreign taxes and for a percentage of certain types of business expenses. Individuals are also allowed credits related to education expenses, retirement savings, child care expenses, and a credit for each child. Each of the credits is subject to specific rules and limitations. Some credits are treated as refundable payments.</p>
<p>All taxpayers are also subject to the <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax" title="Alternative Minimum Tax">Alternative Minimum Tax</a> if their income exceeds certain exclusion amounts. This tax applies only if it exceeds regular income tax, and is reduced by some credits.</p>
<p>Individuals must file income <b>tax returns</b> in each year their income exceeds the standard deduction plus one personal exemption, or if any tax is due. Other taxpayers must file income tax returns each year. These returns may be filed electronically. Generally, an individual's tax return covers the calendar year. Corporations may elect a different tax year. Most states and localities follow the Federal tax year, and require separate returns.</p>
<p>Taxpayers must <b>pay income tax</b> due without waiting for an assessment. Many taxpayers are subject to <a href="/wiki/Withholding_tax" title="Withholding tax">withholding taxes</a> when they receive income. To the extent withholding taxes do not cover all taxes due, all taxpayers must make estimated tax payments.</p>
<p>Failing to make payments on time, or failing to file returns, can result in substantial <b><a href="/wiki/IRS_penalties" title="IRS penalties">penalties</a></b>. Certain intentional failures may result in jail time.</p>
<p>Tax returns may be examined and adjusted by tax authorities. Taxpayers have rights to appeal any change to tax, and these rights vary by jurisdiction. Taxpayers may also go to court to contest tax changes. Tax authorities may not make changes after a certain period of time (generally 3 years).</p>

<p>An individual's marginal income <a href="/wiki/Tax_bracket" title="Tax bracket">tax bracket</a> depends upon his or her income and tax-filing classification. As of 2008, there are six tax brackets for ordinary income (ranging from 10% to 35%) and four classifications: single, married filing jointly (or qualified widow or widower), married filing separately, and <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Household_(Tax)" title="Head of Household (Tax)" class="mw-redirect">head of household</a>.</p>
<p>An individual pays tax at a given bracket only for each dollar within that bracket's range. For example, a single taxpayer who earned $10,000 in 2009 would be taxed 10% of each dollar earned from the 1st dollar to the 8,350th dollar (10% × $8,350 = $835.00), then 15% of each dollar earned from the 8,351st dollar to the 10,000th dollar (15% × $1,650 = $247.50), for a total of $1,082.50. Notice this amount ($1,082.50) is lower than if the individual had been taxed at 15% on the full $10,000 (for a tax of $1,500). This is because the individual's marginal rate (the percentage tax on the last dollar earned, here 15%) has no effect on the income taxed at a lower bracket (here the first $8,350 of income taxed at 10%).</p>
<p>This ensures that every rise in a person's pre-tax salary results in an increase of their after-tax salary. However, it does occur for some wage earners that their marginal tax rate goes down once they have reached the taxible limit for the FICA or social security tax which in 2012 was paid at a rate of 4.2% on earned incomes up to $110100, after which point the wage earners marginal tax rate decreases by 4.2% until the next income tax bracket is reached.</p>

<p>While the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income is 35 percent, average rates that a household in the upper income bracket pays is less. Much of the earnings of those in the top income bracket come from <a href="/wiki/Capital_gains" title="Capital gains" class="mw-redirect">capital gains</a>, interest and dividends, which are taxed at 15 percent. Also because only income up to $106,800 is subject to <a href="/wiki/Payroll_taxes" title="Payroll taxes" class="mw-redirect">payroll taxes</a> of 15.3%, which are paid by the employer and employee, individuals in the upper income bracket pay on average an effective rate not much different than that of other income brackets. The <a href="/wiki/Tax_rate#Effective" title="Tax rate">effective tax rate</a> paid by an individual in the upper income bracket is highly dependent on the ratio of income they earn from capital gains, interest and dividends.

<p>Employers get a deduction for amounts contributed to a qualified employee retirement plan or benefit plan. The employee does not recognize income with respect to the plan until he or she receives a distribution from the plan. The plan itself is organized as a trust and is considered a separate entity. For the plan to qualify for <a href="/wiki/Tax_exemption" title="Tax exemption">tax exemption</a>, and for the employer to get a deduction, the plan must meet minimum participation, vesting, funding, and operational standards.</p>
<p>Examples of qualified plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>pension plans (<a href="/wiki/Defined_benefit_pension_plan" title="Defined benefit pension plan">Defined benefit pension plan</a>),</li>
<li>profit sharing plans (<a href="/wiki/Defined_contribution_plan" title="Defined contribution plan">defined contribution plan</a>),</li>

<li>employee benefit plans,</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Cafeteria_plan" title="Cafeteria plan">Cafeteria plans</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employees or former employees are generally taxed on distributions from retirement or stock plans. Employees are not taxed on distributions from health insurance plans to pay for medical expenses. Cafeteria plans allow employees to choose among benefits (like choosing food in a cafeteria), and distributions to pay those expenses are not taxable.</p>
<p>In addition, individuals may make contributions to <a href="/wiki/Individual_Retirement_Account" title="Individual Retirement Account" class="mw-redirect">Individual Retirement Accounts</a> (IRAs). Those not currently covered by other retirement plans may claim a deduction for contributions to certain types of IRAs. Income earned within an IRA is not taxed until the individual withdraws it.</p>

<li>Credit for the elderly and disabled: A nonrefundable credit up to $1,125</li>
<li>Two mutually exclusive credits for college expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses are also eligible for several credits. These credits are available to individuals and corporations, and can be taken by partners in business partnerships. Among the Federal credits included in a "general business credit" are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Research_%26_Experimentation_Tax_Credit" title="Research &amp; Experimentation Tax Credit">Credit for increasing research expenses</a>.</li>
<li>Work Incentive Credit or credit for hiring people in certain enterprise zones or on welfare.</li>
<li>A variety of industry specific credits.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a Federal <a href="/wiki/Foreign_tax_credit" title="Foreign tax credit">foreign tax credit</a> is allowed for foreign income taxes paid. This credit is limited to the portion of Federal income tax arising due to foreign source income. The credit is available to all taxpayers.</p>
<p>Business credits and the foreign tax credit may be offset taxes in other years.</p>
<p>States and some localities offer a variety of credits that vary by jurisdiction. States typically grant a credit to resident individuals for income taxes paid to other states, generally limited in proportion to income taxed in the other state(s).</p>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax" title="Alternative Minimum Tax">Alternative Minimum Tax</a></div>
<p>Taxpayers must pay the higher of the regular income tax or the <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax" title="Alternative Minimum Tax">Alternative Minimum Tax</a> (AMT). Taxpayers who have paid AMT in prior years may claim a credit against regular tax for the prior AMT. The credit is limited so that regular tax is not reduced below current year AMT.</p>
<p>AMT is imposed at a nearly flat rate (20% for corporations, 26% or 28% for individuals, estates, and trusts) on taxable income as modified for AMT. Key differences between regular taxable income and AMT taxable income include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard deduction and personal exemptions are replaced by a single deduction, which is phased out at higher income levels,</li>
<li>No deduction is allowed individuals for state taxes,</li>
<li>Most miscellaneous itemized deductions are not allowed for individuals,</li>
<li>Depreciation deductions are computed differently, and</li>

<p>The United States tax system allows individuals and entities to choose their <a href="/wiki/Tax_year" title="Tax year" class="mw-redirect">tax year</a>. Most individuals choose the calendar year. There are restrictions on choice of tax year for some closely held entities. Taxpayers may change their tax year in certain circumstances, and such change may require IRS approval.</p>
<p>Taxpayers must determine their taxable income based on their <a href="/wiki/Comparison_of_Cash_Method_and_Accrual_Method_of_accounting" title="Comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting" class="mw-redirect">method of accounting</a> for the particular activity. Most individuals use the cash method for all activities. Under this method, income is recognized when received and deductions taken when paid. Taxpayers may choose or be required to use the accrual method for some activities. Under this method, income is recognized when the right to receive it arises, and deductions are taken when the liability to pay arises and the amount can be reasonably determined. Taxpayers recognizing <a href="/wiki/Cost_of_goods_sold" title="Cost of goods sold">cost of goods sold</a> on inventory must use the accrual method with respect to sales and costs of the inventory.</p>
<p>Methods of accounting may differ for financial reporting and tax purposes. Specific methods are specified for certain types of income or expenses. Gain on sale of property other than inventory may be recognized at the time of sale or over the period in which <a href="/wiki/Installment_sale" title="Installment sale">installment sale</a> payments are received. Income from long term contracts must be recognized ratably over the term of the contract, not just at completion. Other special rules also apply.</p>

<p>There are many Federal tax rules designed to prevent people from abusing the tax system. Provisions related to these taxes are often complex. Such rules include:</p>

<p>Tax rules recognize that some types of businesses do not earn income in the traditional manner and thus require special provisions. For example, Insurance companies must ultimately pay claims to some policy holders from the amounts received as premiums. These claims may happen years after the premium payment. Computing the future amount of claims requires actuarial estimates until claims are actually paid. Thus, recognizing premium income as received and claims expenses as paid would seriously distort an insurance company's income.</p>
<p>Special rules apply to some or all items in the following industries:</p>

<p>Federal income tax is imposed on citizens, residents, and U.S. corporations based on their worldwide income. To mitigate double taxation, a credit is allowed for foreign income taxes. This <a href="/wiki/Foreign_tax_credit" title="Foreign tax credit">foreign tax credit</a> is limited to that part of current year tax caused by foreign source income. Determining such part involves determining the source of income and allocating and apportioning deductions to that income. States tax resident individuals and corporations on their worldwide income, but few allow a credit for foreign taxes.</p>
<p>Federal and state income taxes are imposed on foreign persons on their income within the jurisdiction. Federal rules tax interest, dividends, royalties, and certain other income of foreign persons at a flat rate of 30%. This rate is often reduced under <a href="/wiki/Tax_treaties" title="Tax treaties" class="mw-redirect">tax treaties</a>. Foreign persons are taxed on income from a U.S. business similarly to U.S. persons. Foreign persons are not subject to U.S. tax on capital gains and certain other income. The states tax non-resident individuals only on income earned within the state (wages, etc.) and tax individuals and corporations on business income apportioned to the state. Most of the states otherwise do not impose income tax on persons not resident in the state.</p>
<p>The United States has income <a href="/wiki/Tax_treaties" title="Tax treaties" class="mw-redirect">tax treaties</a> with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/international/article/0,,id=96739,00.html">over 65 countries</a>. These treaties reduce the chance of double taxation by allowing each country to fully tax its citizens and residents and reducing the amount the other country can tax them. Generally the treaties provide for reduced rates of tax on investment income and limits as to which business income can be taxed. The treaties each define which taxpayers can benefit from the treaty.</p>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)" title="Social Security (United States)">Social Security (United States)</a></div>
<p>The United States social insurance system is funded by a tax similar to an income tax. Social Security tax of 6.2% is imposed on wages paid to employees. The tax is imposed on both the employer and the employee. For 2011 and 2012, the employee tax has been reduced by 2% to 4.2%. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html#Series">maximum amount</a> of wages subject to the tax for 2009, 2010, and 2011 was/is $106,800. This amount is indexed for inflation. A companion Medicare Tax of 1.45% of wages is imposed on employers and employees, with no limitation. A self employment tax in like amounts (totaling 15.3%, 13.3% for 2011 and 2012) is imposed on self employed persons.</p>

<p>Persons paying wages or making certain payments to foreign persons are required to withhold income tax from such payments. The Social Security tax is one type of withholding tax. Withholding of income tax is also required. Income tax withholding on wages is based on declarations by employees and tables provided by the IRS. Persons paying interest, dividends, royalties, and certain other amounts to foreign persons must also withhold income tax at a flat rate of 30%. This rate may be reduced by a <a href="/wiki/Tax_treaty" title="Tax treaty">tax treaty</a>. Additional <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc307.html">backup withholding</a> provisions apply to some payments of interest or dividends to U.S. persons.

<p>Individuals (with income above a minimum level), corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts must file annual reports, called <a href="/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)" title="Tax return (United States)">tax returns</a>, with Federal and appropriate state tax authorities. These returns vary greatly in complexity level depending on the type of filer and complexity of their affairs. On the return, the taxpayer reports income and deductions, calculates the amount of tax owed, reports payments and credits, and calculates the balance due.</p>
<p>Federal individual, estate, and trust income tax returns are due by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p509.pdf">April 15</a> for most taxpayers. Corporate returns are due two and one half months following the corporation's year end. Partnership returns are due three and one half months following the partnership's year end. Tax exempt entity returns are due four and one half months following the entity's year end. All Federal returns may be <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc304.html">extended</a>, with most extensions available upon merely filing a single page form. Due dates and extension provisions for state and local income tax returns vary.</p>
<p>Income tax returns generally consist of the basic form with attached forms and schedules. Several forms are available for individuals and corporations, depending on complexity and nature of the taxpayer's affairs. Many individuals are able to use the one page <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040ez.pdf">Form 1040-EZ</a>, which requires no attachments except wage statements from employers (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf">Forms W-2</a>). Individuals claiming itemized deductions must complete <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf">Schedule A</a>. Similar schedules apply for interest (B), dividends (B), business income (C), capital gains (D), farm income (F), and self employment tax (SE). All taxpayers must file those forms for credits, depreciation, AMT, and other items that apply to them.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/IRS_e-file" title="IRS e-file">Electronic filing</a> of tax returns may be done for taxpayers by registered tax preparers.</p>
<p>If a taxpayer discovers an error on a return, or determines that tax for a year should be different, the taxpayer should file an amended return. These returns constitute claims for refund if taxes are determined to have been overpaid.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Income_tax_in_the_United_States&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31" title="Edit section: Tax examinations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tax_examinations">Tax examinations</span></h2>
<p>The IRS and state, and local tax authorities may examine a tax return and propose changes. Changes to tax returns may be made with minimal advance involvement by taxpayers, such as changes to wage or dividend income to correct errors. Other examination of returns may require extensive taxpayer involvement, such as an audit by the IRS. These audits often require that taxpayers provide the IRS or other tax authority access to records of income and deductions. Audits of businesses are usually conducted by IRS personnel at the business location.</p>
<p>Changes to returns are subject to appeal by the taxpayer, including going to court. IRS changes are often first issued as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=180776,00.html">proposed adjustments</a>. The taxpayer may agree to the proposal, or may advise the IRS why it disagrees. Proposed adjustments are often resolved by the IRS and taxpayer agreeing to what the adjustment should be. For those adjustments to which agreement is not reached, the IRS issues a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=160744,00.html">30-day letter</a> advising of the adjustment. The taxpayer may <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12203.pdf">appeal</a> this preliminary assessment within 30 days within the IRS.</p>
<p>The Appeals Division reviews the IRS field team determination and taxpayer arguments, and often proposes a solution that the IRS team and the taxpayer find acceptable. Where agreement is still not reached, the IRS issues an assessment as a notice of deficiency or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=171838,00.html">90-day letter</a>. The taxpayer then has three choices: file suit in <a href="/wiki/United_States_Tax_Court" title="United States Tax Court">United States Tax Court</a> without paying the tax, pay the tax and sue for refund in regular court, or pay the tax and be done. Recourse to court can be costly and time consuming, but is often successful.</p>
<p>IRS computers routinely make adjustments to correct mechanical errors in returns. In addition, the IRS conducts an extensive document matching computer program that compares taxpayer amounts of wages, interest, dividends, and other items to amounts reported by taxpayers. These programs automatically issue 30-day letters advising of proposed changes. Only a very small percentage of tax returns are actually examined. These are selected by a combination of computer analysis of return information and random sampling. The IRS has long maintained a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-001-003.html">program to identify patterns</a> on returns most likely to require adjustment.</p>

<p>Taxpayers are required to voluntarily pay all taxes owed based on the self-assessed tax returns, as adjusted.

Where taxpayers do not pay tax owed, the IRS has strong means to enforce collection. These include the ability to levy bank accounts and seize property. Generally, significant advance notice is given before levy or seizure. However, in certain rarely used <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_F_20_70_30_A_40_II.html">jeopardy assessments</a> the IRS may immediately seize money and property.

<p>Taxpayers and the IRS are both precluded from changing tax after a certain period of time. Generally, this period is three years from the later of the due date of the original tax return or the date the original return was filed.

The period under which the IRS may make changes is unlimited in the case of fraud by the taxpayer.</p>

<p>The courts have generally held that direct taxes are limited to taxes on people (variously called "capitation", "poll tax" or "head tax") and property.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> All other taxes are commonly referred to as "indirect taxes," because they tax an event, rather than a person or property <i>per se.</i><sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> What seemed to be a straightforward limitation on the power of the legislature based on the subject of the tax proved inexact and unclear when applied to an income tax, which can be arguably viewed either as a direct or an indirect tax.</p>

<p>The first income tax suggested in the United States was during the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>. The idea for the tax was based on the British Tax Act of 1798. The British tax law applied progressive rates to income. The British tax rates were 0.08% on income above £60 and 10% on income above £200. The tax proposal was developed in 1814. Because the treaty of Ghent was signed in 1815, ending hostilities and the need for additional revenue, the tax was never imposed in the United States.</p>
<p>In order to help pay for its war effort in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, Congress imposed its first personal income tax in 1861.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> It was part of the <a href="/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1861" title="Revenue Act of 1861">Revenue Act of 1861</a> (3% of all incomes over US $800).<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> This tax was repealed and replaced by another income tax in 1862.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1894, <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party" title="History of the United States Democratic Party">Democrats</a> in Congress passed the <a href="/wiki/Wilson-Gorman_tariff" title="Wilson-Gorman tariff" class="mw-redirect">Wilson-Gorman tariff</a>, which imposed the first peacetime income tax. The rate was 2% on income over $4000, which meant fewer than 10% of households would pay any. The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1895 the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court" title="United States Supreme Court" class="mw-redirect">United States Supreme Court</a>, in its ruling in <i><a href="/wiki/Pollock_v._Farmers%27_Loan_%26_Trust_Co." title="Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.">Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.</a>,</i> held a tax based on receipts from the use of property to be unconstitutional. The Court held that taxes on <a href="/wiki/Economic_rent" title="Economic rent">rents</a> from real estate, on <a href="/wiki/Interest" title="Interest">interest</a> income from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes <a href="/wiki/Dividend" title="Dividend">dividend</a> income) were treated as direct taxes on property, and therefore had to be apportioned (divided among the states based on their populations). Since apportionment of income taxes is impractical, this had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property. However, the Court affirmed that the Constitution did not deny Congress the power to impose a tax on real and personal property, and it affirmed that such would be a direct tax.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical from the time of the <i>Pollock</i> decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below).</p>

<p>In response, Congress proposed the <a href="/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Sixteenth Amendment</a> (ratified by the requisite number of states in 1913),<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> which states:</p>

<p>The modern interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment taxation power can be found in <i><a href="/wiki/Commissioner_v._Glenshaw_Glass_Co." title="Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.">Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.</a></i> 348 <a href="/wiki/United_States_Reports" title="United States Reports">U.S.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://supreme.justia.com/us/348/426/case.html">426</a> (1955). In that case, a taxpayer had received an award of punitive damages from a competitor for antitrust violations and sought to avoid paying taxes on that award. The Court observed that Congress, in imposing the income tax, had defined <a href="/wiki/Gross_income" title="Gross income">gross income</a>, under the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code" title="Internal Revenue Code">Internal Revenue Code of 1939</a>, to include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages or compensation for personal service . . . of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: The <i>Glenshaw Glass</i> case was an interpretation of the definition of "gross income" in section 22 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The successor to section 22 of the 1939 Code is section 61 of the current Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.)</p>
<p>The Court held that "this language was used by Congress to exert in this field the full measure of its taxing power", id., and that "the Court has given a liberal construction to this broad phraseology in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted."<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Court then enunciated what is now understood by Congress and the Courts to be the definition of taxable income, "instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion." Id. at 431. The defendant in that case suggested that a 1954 rewording of the tax code had limited the income that could be taxed, a position which the Court rejected, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definition of gross income has been simplified, but no effect upon its present broad scope was intended. Certainly punitive damages cannot reasonably be classified as gifts, nor do they come under any other exemption provision in the Code. We would do violence to the plain meaning of the statute and restrict a clear legislative attempt to bring the taxing power to bear upon all receipts constitutionally taxable were we to say that the payments in question here are not gross income.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tax statutes passed after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 are sometimes referred to as the "modern" tax statutes. Hundreds of Congressional acts have been passed since 1913, as well as several codifications (i.e., topical reorganizations) of the statutes (see <a href="/wiki/Codification_(law)" title="Codification (law)">Codification</a>).</p>
<p>In <i>Central Illinois Public Service Co. v. United States</i>, 435 <a href="/wiki/United_States_Reports" title="United States Reports">U.S.</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://supreme.justia.com/us/435/21/case.html">21</a> (1978), the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that wages and income are not identical as far as taxes on income are concerned, because income not only <i>includes</i> wages, but any <i>other</i> gains as well. The Court in that case noted that in enacting taxation legislation, Congress "chose not to return to the inclusive language of the Tariff Act of 1913, but, specifically, 'in the interest of simplicity and ease of administration,' confined the <i>obligation to withhold</i> [income taxes] to 'salaries, wages, and other forms of compensation for personal services'" and that "committee reports ... stated consistently that 'wages' meant remuneration 'if paid for services performed by an employee for his employer'".<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Other courts have noted this distinction in upholding the taxation not only of wages, but also of personal gain derived from <i>other</i> sources, recognizing some limitation to the reach of income taxation. For example, in <i>Conner v. United States</i>, 303 F. Supp. 1187 (S.D. Tex. 1969), <i>aff’d in part and rev’d in part</i>, 439 F.2d 974 (5th Cir. 1971), a couple had lost their home to a fire, and had received compensation for their loss from the insurance company, partly in the form of hotel costs reimbursed. The court acknowledged the authority of the IRS to assess taxes on all forms of payment, but did not permit taxation on the compensation provided by the insurance company, because unlike a wage or a sale of goods at a profit, this was not a gain. As the Court noted, "Congress has taxed income, not compensation".</p>
<p>By contrast, other courts have interpreted the Constitution as providing even broader taxation powers for Congress. In <a href="/wiki/Murphy_v._IRS" title="Murphy v. IRS">Murphy v. IRS</a>, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Federal income tax imposed on a monetary settlement recovery that the same court had previously indicated was not income, stating: "[a]lthough the 'Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact,' [ . . . ] it can <i>label</i> a thing income and tax it, so long as it acts within its constitutional authority, which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article I, Sections 8 and 9."<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, in <i>Penn Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Commissioner</i>, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit indicated that Congress could properly impose the Federal income tax on a receipt of money, regardless of what that receipt of money is called:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could well be argued that the tax involved here [an income tax] is an "excise tax" based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer. It certainly is not a tax on property and it certainly is not a capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned. [ . . . ] Congress has the power to impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful, call it what you will.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>United States tax law attempts to define a comprehensive system of measuring income in a complex economy. Many provisions defining income or granting or removing benefits require significant definition of terms. Further, many state income tax laws do not conform with Federal tax law in material respects. These factors and others have resulted in substantial complexity. Even venerable legal scholars like Judge <a href="/wiki/Learned_Hand" title="Learned Hand">Learned Hand</a> have expressed amazement and frustration with the complexity of the U.S. income tax laws. In the article, <i>Thomas Walter Swan</i>, 57 <a href="/wiki/Yale_Law_Journal" title="Yale Law Journal">Yale Law Journal</a> No. 2, 167, 169 (December 1947), Judge Hand wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my own case the words of such an act as the Income Tax… merely dance before my eyes in a meaningless procession: cross-reference to cross-reference, exception upon exception—couched in abstract terms that offer [me] no handle to seize hold of [and that] leave in my mind only a confused sense of some vitally important, but successfully concealed, purport, which it is my duty to extract, but which is within my power, if at all, only after the most inordinate expenditure of time. I know that these monsters are the result of fabulous industry and ingenuity, plugging up this hole and casting out that net, against all possible evasion; yet at times I cannot help recalling a saying of William James about certain passages of Hegel: that they were no doubt written with a passion of rationality; but that one cannot help wondering whether to the reader they have any significance save that the words are strung together with syntactical correctness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Complexity is a separate issue from flatness of rate structures. Also, in the United States, income tax laws are often used by legislatures as policy instruments for encouraging numerous undertakings deemed socially useful — including the buying of life insurance, the funding of employee health care and pensions, the raising of children, home ownership, development of alternative energy sources and increased investment in conventional energy. Special tax provisions granted for any purpose increase complexity, irrespective of the system's flatness or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Income tax is also levied by most <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">U.S. states</a> and many localities on individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts. These taxes are in addition to Federal income tax and are deductible for Federal tax purposes. State and local income tax rates vary from 1% to 16% of taxable income.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Some state and local income tax rates are flat (single rate) and some are graduated. State and local definitions of what income is taxable vary highly. Some states incorporate the Federal definitions by reference. Taxable income is defined separately and differently for individuals and corporations in some jurisdictions. Some states impose alternative or additional taxes based a second measure of income or capital.</p>
<p>States and localities tend to tax all income of residents. States and localities only tax nonresidents on income allocated or apportioned to the jurisdiction. Generally, nonresident individuals are taxed on wages earned in the state based on the portion of days worked in the state. Many states require partnerships to pay tax for nonresident partners.</p>
<p>Tax returns are filed separately for states and localities imposing income tax, and may be due on dates that differ from Federal due dates. Some states permit related corporations to file combined or consolidated returns. Most states and localities imposing income tax require estimated payments where tax exceeds certain thresholds, and require <a href="/wiki/Withholding_tax" title="Withholding tax">withholding tax</a> on payment of wages.</p>

In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because "the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments" (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-06-541">GAO.gov</a>). As residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement, but are excluded from the <a href="/wiki/Supplemental_Security_Income" title="Supplemental Security Income">Supplemental Security Income</a> (SSI) (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents, unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States, do not receive the SSI. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.21/handbook-2114.html">Socialsecurity.gov)</a>, and the island actually receives less than 15% of the <a href="/wiki/Medicaid" title="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> funding it would normally receive if it were a U.S. state (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.magiccarpetautotransport.com/auto-transport/puerto-rico-auto-transport.php">Magiccarpetautotransport.com</a>). However, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.prfaa.com/news/?p=252">p 252).</a> In general, "many federal social welfare programs have been extended to Puerto Rican (<i>sic</i>) residents, although usually with caps inferior to those allocated to the states." (<b>The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion: 1803-1898</b>. By Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H. Sparrow. New York: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers. 2005. Page 167. For a comprehensive coverage of federal programs made extensive to Puerto Rico see Richard Cappalli's <b>Federal Aid to Puerto Rico</b> (1970)). It has also been estimated (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2007/mar07/07-03-28.html">Egleforum.org</a>) that, because the population of the Island is greater than that of 50% of the States, if it were a state, Puerto Rico would have six to eight seats in the House, in addition to the two seats in the Senate.(See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2007/mar07/07-03-28.html">Eagleforum.org</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-17-4-c.html#">CRF-USA.org</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp1109rs5H&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr597.110">Thomas.gov</a> [Note that for the later, the official US Congress database website, you will need to resubmit a query. The document in question is called "House Report 110-597 - <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Democracy_Act#Puerto_Rico_Democracy_Act_of_2007" title="Puerto Rico Democracy Act">Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007</a>." These are the steps to follow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.thomas.gov">THOMAS.gov</a> &gt; Committee Reports &gt; 110 &gt; drop down "Word/Phrase" and pick "Report Number" &gt; type "597" next to Report Number. This will provide the document "House Report 110-597 - 2007", then from the Table of Contents choose "Background and need for legislation".). Another misconception is that the import/export taxes collected by the U.S. on products manufactured in Puerto Rico are all returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury. This is not the case. Such import/export taxes are returned <i>only</i> for rum products, and even then the US Treasury keeps a portion of those taxes (See the "House Report 110-597 - <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Democracy_Act#Puerto_Rico_Democracy_Act_of_2007" title="Puerto Rico Democracy Act">Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007</a>" mentioned above.)</span></li>
