Once the decision was made   in November- December 1968 to make a soft landing from Mars orbit,   the project engineers and scientists began a long colloquy in   which they weighed the demands for lander safety (a crashed lander   equaled no science) against the desire to land at locations most   attractive scientifically. At first, the discussions were   necessarily general in tone; the scientific knowledge (in terms of   both physical data and visual images) was still very limited.   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mariner 4 </FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">, flying by the planet in July 1965, had yielded new   information and the first extraterrestrial images, revealing a   heavily cratered, moonlike surface.

Some   scientists concluded that this meant there had not been much wind   or water activity on the surface.

Donald G. Rea,   deputy director of planetary programs in the Office of Space   Science at NASA Headquarters, during this first Science Steering   Group meeting raised the landing site question when he asked for   thoughts on how best to use the orbiter in support of the landed   science program. Thomas Mutch, a geologist, began the discussion.   The lander imaging team he headed had not considered landing site   selection, since members thought orbital images were of little   value in the site selection process. They assumed that orbital   photographs would not be able to pick up geological features   smaller than a football stadium (i.e., resolutions in the 100- to   1000-meter range). Ground-based scientists could not possibly see   the lander or smaller scale hazards that could affect its safety,   and Mutch's team did not believe that orbital pictures would help   them pick either a good science site or a good landing   spot.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.1">1</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="278"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">278</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;Wolf   Vishniac of the biology team disagreed. Orbiter imaging could   provide a valuable means for differentiating between places of low   and high biological potential. He also believed that a possible   strategy for selecting a landing site might be to set one craft   down in a dark area and the other in a light area. The difference   between Mutch's evaluation and that expressed by Vishniac was in   itself illuminating. Mutch was thinking in, terms of the   small-scale features (measured in centimeters) that the lander   would be able to see. Vishniac was basing his comments on the   large-scale light and dark features observed through Earth-based   telescopes. Between these two scales lay an unknown range of   Martian topographical features that would mean the difference   between a safe landing and a crash.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The second steering group meeting, at   Stanford University a month later, heard additional possibilities   for using orbiter imaging in selecting a landing zone. On the   large scale, Seymour Hess, the Viking meteorologist, expressed the   hope that the orbiter could find a large, flat area on which the   lander could he placed, so his weather station would function more   effectively. He preferred a place with no surface "relief for 10's   to 100's of kilometers." Surely the orbiter images could spot such   a tableland. But Klaus Biemann, a chemist from MIT, noted that in   the search for life forms, as well as in the molecular analysis   his team would make, it was preferable that the first lander sit   down in a warm, wet, low site. His ideal site demanded the fewest   degrees below freezing, the highest traces of water in whatever   form it might be found, and the highest atmospheric pressure   (i.e., the lowest elevation) possible; life would most likely   survive under those conditions.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to the imaging system, the   Water-vapor mapping and thermal mapping experiments being planned   would give the Viking team clues to the best sites while the   lander was still attached to the orbiter, but the exact role of   the orbiter would become clear only with time.

The hypothetical   landing sites being used to develop the "preliminary reference   mission" had not been selected for their scientific merit. They   had been chosen simply to give the analysis and design specialists   something to work with in creating spacecraft design requirements.   Finally, he reported that his office would develop the   "operational mission design," which would guide the conduct of the   real missions, by working hand in hand with the landing site   working group.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The working group members began to discuss   the desirable features and characteristics of Viking landing sites   with Tom Voting suggesting that initially they ignore any   potential system or mission constrains. Carl Sagan led off the   brainstorming session considering the problem in terms of three   primary areas of investigation-biology, geology, and meteorology.   Comments on biology centered on the availability of water,   atmospheric and surface temperatures, and ultraviolet radiation.   Each of these three variables could affect the possibility of   finding life forms.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The meteorologists wished to observe four   related phenomena over a period of time-seasonal darkening, the   daily night-day cycle, long-term meteorological variations, and   the annual polar-cap regression process.

William Baum of the Lowell Observatory's Planetary   Research Center presented a status report on Earth-based motion   studies of clouds on Mars. Cloud patterns were being mapped under   the International Planetary Patrol Programs hourly each day, and   recent daily photographs had shown significant changes, but he   could not say how these alterations might be correlated with   seasonal or other patterns.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first working group meeting closed   with a discussion of the relationship between the Mariner 71   mission (</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mariner 9</FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">, launched 8 May 1971) and Viking.

One of those specifics was the orbiter   visual-imaging subsystem, which had been identified as a candidate   for elimination or modification to reduce costs substantially. The   project stretch-out required paring costs, and Jim Martin and his   colleagues sought ways to do so while still saving the orbiter and   other key elements of the proposed mission. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.5">5</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="280"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">280</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;The Science   Steering Group had identified three alternative approaches to   orbital imaging that would save dollars-the Viking camera system   already proposed; a slight variation of the system in which the   image motion-compensation device was eliminated at an estimated   $1-million saving; or a modified Mariner 71 imaging system (using   improved optics), at a possible saving of $8 million.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.6">6</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> At the July 1970 Science Steering Group meeting,   Viking project scientist Jerry Soffen had told his colleagues that   the cost reduction exercise in progress made it necessary for them   to decide which investigations or parts of investigations were the   most important scientifically. Each science leader had to defend   the costs and merits of his team's experiment and recommend ways   to conserve money. When Mike Carr-orbiter imaging team leader and   an astrogeologist from the U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park.   California-had defended the orbiter television camera system, he   had argued that the costs were as low as they could be. When asked   if the Mariner 71 camera system could be used on Viking as well,   he had said emphatically, no.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Carr's orbiter imaging team reported in   October that the orbital imaging from Viking would substantially   enhance the scientific value of all the other experiments.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.7">7</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> The imaging system would improve the probability of   a safe landing, help define the environment in which the lander   experiments would be performed, and permit comparisons of the   landing site with other regions on Mars. The team was convinced   that the proposed Viking camera system would yield superior   pictures. "A modified 1971 camera would provide only minimal   support for the Viking mission and would add only little to our   knowledge of the planet. The Viking camera system outperforms the   [Mariner] 71 camera in. . . .very fundamental ways.'' Mariner 71's   camera was a slow-rate vidicon unit, requiring a cycle time of 42   seconds to capture a single image. Viking's fast vidicon worked in   a tenth of that time. To get overlapping coverage with the Mariner   71 A-camera, it would have to look at a larger area, losing detail   in its resolving power. Mariner 71's B-cameras had a resolution   comparable to the Viking stem, but with a slow vidicon system it   could not produce contiguous frames of coverage and would leave   gaps between pictures. Viking's cameras would yield   high-resolution and overlapping images, so the Viking team could   get the photographic images they needed of the entire landing area   in a single pass.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The fast vidicon camera system put other   demands on the team, however. On the orbiter, the camera would   require a fast, reliable tape recorder to store all the electronic   bits into which the images had been coded. The telemetry system   and ground-based recorders must be capable of handling the data   flow, and the image-reconstruction and processing computers and   related equipment would have to process that data as quickly as it   was received. But Carr believed that this elaborate complex of   machines and men was essential to Viking's success. "The Viking   camera will always outperform the [Mariner] system by delivering   more resolution per area [<A NAME="281"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">281</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;covered, by   allowing greater flexibility in choice of filters and lighting   conditions and making more effective use of a lower periapsis."   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="#st44">**</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> </FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">These performance differences were   important to site certification. "With only two landers judicious   choice of landing sites is essential to ensure that they will   result in maximum scientific return." According to Carr and his   colleagues, orbital imaging would be the key to site selection by   providing:</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">(1) Numerical terrain data (crater   statistics, slope frequency distributions, etc.) such that the   landability of different sites can be compared and   assessed.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">(2) Distribution frequencies of features   such as craters, ridges, block fields, that are potentially   detrimental (or advantageous) to lander experiments.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">(3) Absolute and relative elevation   measurements as a supplement and check to radar and [infrared]   data.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">(4) Information on the geologic nature of   the potential landing sites.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">(5) Information on seasonally variable   clouds, condensations, and surface albedo differences both locally   and regionally around potential sites. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.8">8</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The orbital imaging team was sure that the   difference in results from the Mariner 71 and the Viking systems   would be striking. Mariner 71 would be unable to portray objects   smaller than 1 kilometer in diameter, while resolution with the   Viking system, judged to be about 45 meters, was "close to the   limit from which data can be extrapolated to the scale of the   lander [2-3 meters]." The orbiter imaging specialists contended   that using a modified Mariner 71 system would render the imaging   "virtually worthless for obtaining terrain statistics and the   distribution of specific features at the scale of the lander or   making useful elevation measurements." To make their point, they   used 80-meter-and 1-kilometer-resolution photographs of the   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Apollo 14 </FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> landing site on the moon to illustrate how   sensitive geological and topographical analyses were to this   change.

On   19 September 1971, the Science Steering Group met in a special   session where the science team leaders got the bad news. Despite   all efforts to reduce costs in management and engineering phases,   Jerry Soffen had to tell his colleagues they must reduce the   overall science costs by $17 million to $22 million. Several   methods were mentioned, but each team quickly put in writing   reasons why its own experiment should be exempted from the   reductions.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The 6-7 October meeting of the steering   group at the California Institute of Technology concentrated   solely on money matters. Three options for reducing costs were   discussed at length. The first called for deleting some routine   activities-holding fewer meetings, and the like; perhaps as much   as $3 million could be saved here. By simplifying the gas   chromatograph-mass spectrometer and the biology instrument,   another $5 million or so might be cut. Reducing science activities   on board the orbiter could save another million. Other parings and   deletions brought the total potential savings to just over $22   million. The second option called for eliminating the gas   chromatograph-mass spectrometer, which had a predicted $35-million   price tag, but the Science Steering Group preferred not to act on   this item until it had a better feel for the technical feasibility   of building the instrument.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="284"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">284</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;Option 3   was the removal of the imaging system from the orbiter. As Hal   Masursky recalled the scene, Soffen said, "We have a   17-22-million-dollar problem and the Orbiter Imaging System costs   25 million. Any suggestions?" Most of the steering group members   were reluctant to recommend removing those cameras until they saw   the Mariner 71 photographs. They would make that recommendation   only if the Mariner images showed a bland, uninteresting surface.   Mike Care and Hal Masursky believed the imaging system was   necessary for site certification regardless of what data Mariner   71 produced. C. Barney Farmer, team leader for the Mars   atmospheric water-vapor detection experiment, expressed his   concern about the whole idea of using these meetings to effect   cost reductions. He went on record indicating his reluctance to   recommend the removal of any full investigation. The group   postponed a decision on the third option until January-February   1972. Money had been, was, and would continue to be a problem.   Still, it was only one part of the problem of searching for a   landing site. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.11">11</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></CENTER>      <P><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">PREPARING FOR SITE   SELECTION</FONT></B></CENTER></P>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Besides considering the imaging system and   discussing desired landing site characteristics at its October   1970 meeting, the landing site working group also considered what   it could gain from Mariner 71.

In NASA shorthand, this tactic was called the   adaptive mode-acquiring data from a spacecraft and quickly using   it to modify the mission. The Viking team was certain it would   need this skill, and it would require discipline, planning, and   timely responsiveness to succeed. In the plans for Mariner 71,   data processing was not scheduled to catch up with acquisition for   a year, and Masursky feared that unless adequately supported, the   complete process could take 5 to 10 years, which was obviously too   slow to be of value to Viking.

He   noted that the "present cycle of discussion on landing site   selection is to aid development of the Viking Project Reference   Mission #1," a theoretical model that would be used in planning   mission operations and designing the spacecraft. Since in some   respects this was a training exercise. there was no commitment to   the specific landing sites they had selected.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In considering landing sites for the two   Vikings, some factors would be certain to change. But those that   would likely remain unaltered fell into two categories,   engineering and scientific. Under the engineering heading, the   30&#176; south to 30&#176; north latitude range for landing sites   was dictated by the angle at which the spacecraft would have to   enter the Martian atmosphere to obtain optimum aerodynamic   deceleration and proper thermal conditions. Second, nearly all of   the working group members agreed that the lander should sit down   where atmospheric pressures were the highest. As on Earth, high   pressure corresponds with lower elevation, but whereas sea level   pressure on Earth averages about 1013 millibars, surface pressures   on Mars are 100 times lower. Pressure at the lowest elevation was   believed to be close to 10 millibars and at the top of mountains   less than l millibar but the uncertainty in these values was 20 or   30 percent at the time. The Viking scientists hoped that Mariner   photographs and ground-based radar studies would give them more   exact information on atmospheric pressure relative to   topographical features. A third engineering concern was the effect   that Martian surface winds would have on the spacecraft. The Mars   engineering model with which the team was working predicted winds   of less than 90 meters per second, but Sagan noted that newer   calculations indicated the possibility of winds up to 140 to 200   meters per second.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">If such winds are encountered during   landing maneuvers, the survivability of the spacecraft is very   much in question; and such winds, even after a safe landing, might   provide various engineering embarrassments. It will shortly be   possible to predict which times and places are to be avoided.ÉSuch   considerations obviously require further theoretical study and   (with Mariner Mars '71) observational study. But they do indicate   how new parameters, not previously considered, can severely impact   landing site choices. Such considerations imply that any landing   site selected at the present time should not be too firmly   imbedded in the Project's thinking. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.13">13</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other technical factors affecting the   choice of a landing spot included the time of day on Mars at   touchdown, the size of the landing target, and a pair strategy   calling for one very safe (but perhaps less interesting) site and   [<A NAME="286"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">286</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] one of greater   scientific potential. Depending in part on progress made in   developing the lander tape recorder. Sagan thought that it might   be desirable to land in the late afternoon to ensure that some   lander images of the planet would be transmitted to the orbiter   before it passed out of view of the lander, giving the team at the   Jet Propulsion Lab maximum assurance of obtaining at least some   initial pictures of the surface. They had to face the possibility   that the lander could die while the orbiter continued on its way   around Mars; it would be 24.6 hours before the orbiter passed over   the lander a second time. Should a late afternoon touchdown be   called for, those areas with dense cloud development at the time   of day would have to be excluded. Turning to the target, or   landing ellipse, Sagan indicated that it was currently 400 by 840   kilometers, which would eliminate areas appreciably smaller than   this zone. The pair strategy had been devised for reasons of   "survivability." One landing site would be selected with "safety   considerations weighed very highly"; One landing site would be   selected with "safety considerations weighed very highly''; if the   first mission failed on entry, the team would want to have a   preselected, extremely safe site for the second lander. "It is   therefore necessary to consider some sites almost exclusively on   engineering grounds." Sagan hoped planners could "back off from   this requirement a little bit and seek out safe contingency sites   with at least acceptable science.'' Alan Binder had made this same   point earlier but somewhat more bluntly: "The engineering criteria   must reign since it hardly need be mentioned that a crashed lander   is not very useful even if it did crash in the most interesting   part of the planet." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.14">14</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> Sagan wrote, ''Before any Viking lander is   committed to a given site, there must be reasonably extensive   Mariner Mars '71 type data, including but not restricted to   imagery." He thought that selection of alternative candidate sites   should be based on Mariner 71 data, and certification of the   various candidates should be based on Viking data, which would be   of higher resolution.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Sagan's report then turned to the working   group consensus on science criteria for the landing sites. Many   members believed it would be useful to pair the first two landing   sites in such a manner that each one would be a control for the   measurements made at its companion location. A reason for varying   from this plan would be positive results from the biology   experiment on the first lander; then the Viking team might wish to   land the second craft as near the first one as possible to   determine if the results could be duplicated. The best guess at   the time was that Martian life, "or at least that subset of   Martian life which the Viking biology package is likely to   detect,'' would be found where there was water near the surface.   But there was still considerable debate about the nature and   amount of water that might be found. Low atmospheric pressures and   temperatures always below 0&#176;C did not augur well for the   presence of liquid water. Still, Sagan and others believed that it   was possible to have life-sustaining water present in other   forms.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The uncratered terrain observed in the   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mariner 4 </FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> photographs was of possible interest.

Taking into consideration all these factors, Sagan   listed his six favorite landing spots, but several of his   colleagues came up with other suggestions of their own.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.15">15</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">After considerable freewheeling debate of   the kind that characterized many of the working group's meetings,   the group recommended three sites for each lander.

The mission planners indicated that it would be best to   land the first Viking in the northern latitude, or during the   Martian summer. Immediately following the working group sessions,   the mission analysis and design team subjected the six candidate   sites to a preliminary examination, and its first quick look   revealed no apparent difficulties.

And to prepare maps from Mariner 71   photography, stereo -plotters and computers for analytical   cartography, as well as more experienced cartographers, must be   brought in. The photogeologist noted that these problems would be   discussed with the JPL Mariner people later in the month. But at   Carl Sagan's request, these issues were raised that afternoon at a   joint session with the Science Steering Group. The advisory body   agreed that modest expenditures of Viking funds would be justified   if supporting Mariner 71 data processing would contribute to the   success of Viking.

To   the north, Syrtis Major was beginning to disappear beneath the   haze. On 28 September, a new cloud developed in Eos, a region   later found to be part of the canyon lands of Mars.

Most of   what they had to say had already been made public during an early   February press briefing held at NASA Headquarters. Bradford Smith,   deputy team leader for the television experiment, had told   reporters that the Martian atmosphere had begun to clear slowly in   December, with more rapid progress during the first week of   January. Pictures now available of the Martian surface led the   science team to conclude that the planet was a far more dusty   place than they previously had thought. But at that same press   conference, Hal Masursky had some positive words about the dust   storm. The first 30 to 40 days of the mission had given the   scientists an opportunity to study the dynamics of the Martian   atmosphere. "It will be 15 years....before such a large dust storm   can be seen'' again. The storm, however, forced the mission   planners to devise a reconnaissance scheme for looking at the   planet from a higher altitude and photographing any clear areas   with the high-resolution camera. Once the clearing trend started,   the Mariner team began a new series of mapping sequences that were   at least as complex as the original mission plan.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The mapping process revealed a fantastic   planet, strewn with features that caught scientists' immediate   attention. Huge volcanoes with attendant lava flows were found in   the Tharsis region. And features that had been observed   previously-such as three dark areas called North Spot, Middle   Spot, and South Spot-were now clearly volcanoes. The caldera,   formed by the collapse of the cone, of North Spot was 32   kilometers across, while the width of South Spot's crater was 120   kilometers. But these volcanoes were all dwarfed by Nix Olympica,   which was renamed Olympus Mons. To the east of Tharsis, the   Mariner team found a high plateau, much of which was 8 kilometers   above the surface, that evidenced complex fault zones. Some areas   had been uplifted; others had been depressed; in places large   blocks had been tilted, "We think this indicates a very dynamic   substratum under the Mars crust,'' Masursky noted, He showed the   press some slides of the great chasm, which was some 4000   kilometers long and hundreds of kilometers wide at points. Looking   at this complex of valleys and tributaries so recently obscured by   dust, Masursky commented, "We are hard put to find a mechanism   other than water to form this kind of complex, erosional channel.   If it were not Mars, and if water weren't so hard to come by   there, [<A NAME="293"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">293</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] we would think   that these were water channels."

The   crispness of the edges on the volcanic piles and the absence of   cratering seemed to indicate that these volcanoes were,   geologically speaking, young. Just how young was uncertain. The   fault zones showed that the crust had been broken many, many   times, Mars evidently was a dynamic, geochemically evolved planet   and not just a static accumulation of cosmic debris as some   experts had theorized after the Mariner 1969 flights. With the   realization that Mars was an active planet in geological terms,   the search for possible life forms became more exciting.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.25">25</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Next at the February meeting, Al Binder   described some of the work the Viking data analysis team was   doing.

James D. Porter of   Martin Marietta, Viking mission analysis and design program   engineer, brought the working group up to date on the engineering   constraints that impinged on the site selection process. One was   obvious: north or south of 25&#176; latitude, the spacecraft in   orbit would not receive adequate solar radiation on its solar   panels to keep its batteries charged. Without that power, the   orbiter could not relay messages to Earth. Other problems   concerned the surface the lander encountered: slopes it touched   down on had to he less than 19&#176;, free of rocks and other   hazards greater than 22 centimeters in height. Porter was also   worried about winds during descent. A landing area that had winds   greater than 70 meters per second was automatically eliminated.   Porter's presentation was a status report, and he would be keeping   the landing site working group informed as new restrictions were   discovered.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the day's discussions progressed, a   lively debate developed over the nature of the processes that had   shaped the Martian terrain. Areology, the scientific study of the   planet Mars, was still less than a precise enterprise. Tim Mutch,   in considering the terrain map (1:25 000 000 scale) that the   Viking data analysis team had developed, questioned how the   working group could extrapolate terrain information from such a   map to determine topographical features as small as 22   centimeters. Several men present believed that rock sizes in the   centimeter range could be determined from ground-based radar,   since it would supposedly provide information on Martian features   that small. Combining radar data with high-resolution images   similar to the Mariner B-frame pictures had worked well in   selecting landing sites on the moon. Others suggested that the   radar-photo analysis approach would not be as simple on Mars; the   varying kinds of terrain created by different processes would make   interpretation of radar data more difficult. At this meeting, the   rift between believers in radar and believer, in photography first   appeared. That division would widen and characterize many of the   discussions held, right up to the time of the Viking landings.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.31">31</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">After additional consideration of physical   characteristics for landing sites, Howard Robins turned the   meeting's attention toward the 35 sites that had been proposed for   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mariner 9 </FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> photographic coverage. </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">Mariner 9 </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> had   [<A NAME="299"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">299</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] taken 6876   photos covering 85 percent of the planet.

The 4 additional sites "are in areas which   have become accessible on the basis of Binder's recent revision of   the Mars Topography map and updated Viking Lander capability.''   Masursky and his colleagues pointed out that "these sites are   typical of some of the most striking geomorphologic features of   the Martian surface which have not been considered in previous   targeting exercises" They also presented alternate choices for   landing sites should engineering constraints   [<A NAME="300"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">300</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] continue to   change.

Since early spacecraft   maneuvers had consumed more propellant than anticipated, the total   number of Viking target sites to be photographed had been reduced   to 24. As of early July, 15 areas had been photographed with the   wide-angle A-frame camera and three times with the high-resolution   B-frame camera.

He meant that no site   changes would be made for minor reasons; they could react only to   important findings or new safety considerations. ``I want us to   select the best sites to December that our collective wisdom will   permit." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.40">40</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The debate that followed Young's   statements demonstrated just how divergent opinions were among the   33 specialists present.

For example, features were just   now becoming visible on the floor of the region called Hellas as   the dust in the atmosphere dissipated. He expected his whole   outlook on landing sites to alter by February when the skies would   be clearer and orbital photographs more revealing. Jerry Soffen   ranked the experiments proposed for Viking, giving the search for   life the highest priority, which meant that water or evidence of   water in the past would give a region good marks as a landing   spot.

If   the site was certified, the lander would be committed to it; if   not, the backup site would be the next choice. If results from the   Mission A orbiter and lander supported the preselected Mission B   sites, certification would be made in the same way as for Mission   A, but spacecraft B could be retargeted to a new area if data   indicated the need.

Why couldn't Viking land far north, 65&#176; or   higher, touching down where the polar cap had recently retreated?   He had originally expressed the desire to go north in a   handwritten memo to Howie Robins in June, believing the zone   between 30&#176;S and 30&#176;N to be too restrictive.

After Soffen introduced new member Noel Hinners of the   Apollo Lunar Explorations Office at NASA Headquarters and Jim   Porter briefed the group on engineering constraints, Young   addressed the key topic: Should they try to land a craft near the   north polar region of Mars? His answer was no. It could be done,   but the risks to the landing craft did not seem to justify the   potential gains. Equally significant, not only would it cost   between $2 million and $20 million more depending on hardware   changes, it would also slow the project's schedule. Young believed   the combined increase in money and time was bad news, but he was   ready with a detailed reply to the scientists' grumblings. First,   landing in the north polar region was technically feasible, an   important consideration for future missions. And second, the   Viking Project Office understood the high scientific interest in   the far north. But third, studies indicated high- risk or   high-cost schedule impact because additional communications   equipment would have to be developed to ensure adequate links   between the orbiter and the lander. With a fixed launch date, the   risk was just too high. Because of a November 1976 solar   conjunction-Mars would be out of view from Earth-a delay in   launching the spacecraft would cut into the prime cycle of science   data gathering. All factors considered, Viking 75 would not try to   land closer to the northern polar region. John Naugle also   restated the budget limitations, firmly reminding the scientists   that no additional money would be made available. Information   gathered by Mariner 9 regarding the polar regions would have to be   filed away for use on some future mission to Mars. Considerably   more discussion ensued about sites in the 30&#176;S to 30&#176;N   latitude range, as each member of the working group had the   opportunity to indicate his preferences. At the conclusion of the   meeting, they recommended 10 sites.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR WIDTH="75%">   </FONT>      <DT><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0   summary="Table 48.

Changes like these would become part of the   routine process of landing a spacecraft on the surface of another   -planet, and this was just the beginning. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.45">45</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Polar Option Revisited</FONT></I>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">By the time the landing site working group   next met, in December 1972, Mariner 9 had completed its mission   and Joshua Lederberg had thumped on the desk of NASA Administrator   James C. Fletcher. On 27 October when </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">Mariner 9 </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> used the   last of its attitude control propellant, a command was Sent from   JPL's Mariner Mission Control that shutdown the spacecraft's   transmitters. Despite initial setbacks, the mission had mapped the   entire planet, permitting Viking scientists to gather far more   images of candidate landing zones than they had originally   anticipated. The infrared and ultraviolet instruments aboard   Mariner had also observed large portions of the planet. As the   data were being analyzed in November, Lederberg met with Fletcher   and Naugle to express the scientists' concern that the   [<A NAME="305"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">305</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] polar region was   not being given a fair chance because the "engineers" -   Lederberg's shorthand for the project management- had not done   their homework earlier and examined polar regions for possible   landing zones. The upshot of his argument was the decision by   Fletcher, in consultation with George M. Low, his deputy, and   Naugle, to hold in abeyance any final action on a polar region   landing until they had heard from all the science team leaders.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.46">46</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Armed with the latest in a growing series   of maps based on </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mariner 9   </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> data, the landing site team met   4-5 December at Martin Marietta's Orlando facility to pick the   primary and secondary landing sites for </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">Viking l </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> and   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">2 </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">.   When Tom Young opened the session, he admitted that the question   of a polar landing site had not yet been resolved, but the working   group would go ahead with the original task of naming the landing   sites in the equatorial band. In turn, John Naugle commented   briefly on the strategy for a polar landing mission: "Send Mission   A to the equatorial zone and target Mission B for the polar   regions. Then if A succeeds, allow B to continue to the polar   landing site, but if A fails, retarget B to an equatorial site,''   The Viking Project Office would provide a work plan and cost   estimate to NASA Headquarters by 15 January 1973. Young responded   that the ground rules would be kept open but no hardware changes   would be made yet. If a decision was made to go to the pole, a   fifth and sixth site should be selected; that is, a primary and   secondary site in the polar region. NASA intended to hold a press   conference in late December to announce the landing targets, and   Young wanted any decisions reached by the working group before   then withheld until the briefing.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The December 1972 announcement was not   made; it was 7 May before any decision was made public. Between   the December 1972 and the April 1973 sessions of the landing site   working group, there was a great deal of argument, debate, or   spinning of wheels-depending on one's perspective. Unanimity over   where to land was difficult to achieve. During the 4 December   dialogue, which lasted some 12 hours, only one site was selected.   The group agreed that the primary site for the first lander would   be at Chryse, 19.5&#176;N longitude, 34&#176; latitude. On the   fifth, after another lengthy discussion, site 10 from the list,   Apollinares, 9&#176;S, 181&#176;, was picked as the prime target   for the second lander; site 9, Memnonia, 9&#176;S,144&#176;, would   be the backup. A secondary target for the first lander was not   selected, because of concern over the strength of the surface at   site l (21&#176;N, 157&#176;) and because site 2 (19&#176;N,   65&#176;) had undesirable elevation characteristics.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.47">47</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">A backup target for </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">Viking 1 </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> and the   question of going further north continued to be nagging problems   into the early months of 1973.

On one hand, team members were   enthusiastic about a polar landing coupled with a successful   equatorial touchdown, because of the potential benefits to lander   science. But on the other, they were apprehensive about the impact   of such a landing on the orbiter imaging experiment. If the   orbiter was used to support a lander in the polar regions, the   craft could not be employed to photograph other areas of the   planet as planned, because the orbiter's path would have to he   altered considerably to accommodate a polar site. Carr said, "We   are unable at this time to adequately, confidently assess some of   the implications of a polar landing because of inadequate study of   the problem."</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Carr was also concerned that landing one   spacecraft so far north would curtail the two "walks" around the   planet, during which the orbiter would photograph Martian features   at higher resolution. Four years would have passed since   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mariner 9 </FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> did the same; to lose this comparative photography   would reduce measurably the understanding of the processes at work   shaping the planet's features. If there were great pressure to go   north, "the disadvantages could be tolerated if the Lander were to   go to a site that exhibits uniquely polar phenomena ie one that is   at least as far north as 75&#176;. We would be very reluctant to   accept these substantial disadvantages for a site at 65&#176;N,   which is not likely to be significantly different geologically   from an equatorial site." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.49">49</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Physical properties investigator Richard   W. Shorthill said that he had discussed the "north polar site'   with his team, and it had not favored the proposal. From the   start, this group had considered safety to be the prime   requirement for a Viking landing site. "Considering the present   state of knowledge we cannot support a North polar landing.''   There was no radar coverage of the polar regions-"</FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">no </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> information on   surface roughness at the scale of the spacecraft, </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">no </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> information on   the mechanical properties of the surface materials.'' Mariner   imagery of the polar regions had been either ambiguous or too   obscured by dust for a reliable evaluation.

The behavior of soil   with intersticial ice in a Martian environment [is] poorly   understood. One could visualize a sublimation process that yields   a porous under dense surface material more than 40 cm thick. On   the other hand the surface could be wind swept yielding a rock   like surface composed of soil and ice.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Furthermore, the safe landing of the first   spacecraft at the equator would not ensure that vehicle's   longevity on the surface. The team believed that the second lander   should also be sent to a relatively safe place. Shorthill also   looked at the question of money. He was strongly opposed to   cutting back on science funding to provide changes in the lander   and orbiter so that they might operate to the polar region. "Any   new funds NASA might make available for design changes required   for polar operations could better be used to increase mission   success in areas where previous cutbacks have reduced the chances   of success" -areas such as testing, mission planning, team   activities, and continued assessment of the surface properties of   the equatorial landing sites.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">After first evaluating the polar proposal   on its scientific merits, Seymour L. Hess of the meteorology team   had subsequently developed reservations. He found it "incredible   that a project with such severe financial problems has accepted   the addition of a thirteenth experiment and now seems to be about   to swallow an additional major cost for the polar option." He also   believed that the polar site proposal would be bad for the entire   project. "One of the major sources of our troubles is that NASA   has been extremely ambitious in the total amount of science it is   scheduling in comparison to its fiscal resources. To add this new   ambition is, in my opinion, fiscal recklessness."   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.50">50</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Harold P. Klein, biology team leader, had   another point of view. Klein told Soffen that the biology team had   once again reviewed the polar versus equatorial site question at   its 11 December meeting and regarded the presence of water as   ``the most critical parameter in the search for life on Mars.''   After listening to all the facts and opinions, the team believed   that liquid water would be less likely on the equatorial regions   than in areas closer to the poles. ``We are not, of course,   assured that the polar regions will afford opportunities for the   production of Water under or near the ice caps, but we feel that   these regions afford a significantly better prospect for this than   the more equatorial zones." Therefore, Klein reported that his   team strongly supported the proposition that at least one landing   be made in the polar region. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.51">51</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Tim Mutch made a personal response. He had   written one letter to Soffen that was a "dispassionate,   scientific-engineering analysis," which came to a slightly   negative to neutral conclusion on the polar landing proposal.   After thinking about what he had written, Mutch concluded that he   had probably missed the real issue: "The point is that Viking is   an [<A NAME="308"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">308</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] exciting journey   of exploration. The fact that it survives NASA's budget cuts is   partly attribute to its wide appeal. Scientific skepticism not   withstanding, laymen are intrigued by this bold search for life on   another planet." Looking at Viking in this framework, Mutch had   asked himself what all the talk about a polar landing really   meant. "We are maintaining that we should keep open the   possibility-only the possibility-of going to a northern latitude   after the first lander has been on the surface almost two weeks   and has been working perfectly for that period." A second   successful landing did not guarantee a doubling of the scientific   knowledge gained about the planet. Indeed, exploring near the   poles might yield less information than gained at the equator. The   Lederberg scenario was only a "long shot," which may or may not be   worthwhile, but to Mutch, the single, most important aspect of the   mission was exploration. If the lander is a success, then Viking   as a project will be a success. Keeping the polar option open   permitted them to continue playing the role of bonafide explorers.   "The public will appreciate this (and ultimately we're responsible   to those tax-payers who foot the bill). In essence we've   identified the two most disparate areas on the planet and we're   considering going to both. It's not that different from any polar   journey. You equip yourself as best you can. You equip yourself as   best you can. You set some intermediate reasonable goals, and if   all goes well you make a dash for the pole."</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although the polar option would increase   the cost by at least $2 million to $3 million, Mutch felt that it   should be preserved. He thought that Administrator Fletcher should   award the additional money. "Failing that, it does not seem   unreasonable to absorb it within existing Viking budgets-even   though there will be associated pain." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.52">52</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Not all of colleagues agreed with him, and   Young and Soffen continued to receive letters concerning the   matter as late as the day of the next landing site working group   session, 8 February, Robert Hargraves of the magnetic properties   team seemed to favor trying a polar landing. "If `A' is   successful, the prospects of a 77 or 79 Viking Mission are dim,   and the engineering risk is not horrendous, I'd say let's try.''   Hugh Kieffer, representing the infrared thermal mapping team, said   that it "moderately opposed" north polar landing site considering   only the infrared thermal standpoint of lander science, they noted   that it was a proper objective for Viking; however, it would be   difficult to validate such a site for safety. Kieffer, therefore,   Was "hesitantly in favor of a polar site." C. Barney Farmer,   leader of the Mars atmospheric water detector experiment team, was   also somewhat ambivalent in his analysis. A polar landing would   not be good for his group's experiment, but from the overall   science strategy it seemed to be the thing to do. He favored "a   polar B-site strategy. " The molecular analysis team, led by Klaus   Biemann, had met on 10 January at JPL, deciding unanimously in   favor of trying a polar landing. It had not considered the funding   and risk problems, assuming that the final decision-makers   [<A NAME="309"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">309</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] at the Viking   Project Office and NASA Headquarters would take them into account.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.53">53</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">When the landing site team met at Langley   in February, it began to tackle its two problems-a backup site for   the first lander and a possible site in the polar latitudes. All   aspects of the polar problem were reviewed again, as Carl Sagan   outlined the positive and the negative. Sagan had come to the side   of the those who favored safety. In a 12 January letter to Young,   he had said, "When I total up the pros and cons I find that the   scientific advantage of a polar landing site, while real, is far   outweighed by the risks." He believed the successful landing of   the second spacecraft in the polar region was actually much less   than 50-50. When he equated that to losing $200 million-the total   projected cost of a future Mariner-Jupiter-Saturn probe-he   considered the risk unjustified, but Sagan had other worries on   his mind. He was still concerned about the possibility of the   first lander's disappearing in quicksand at one of the equatorial   sites and favored further study of the meaning of the radar data,   expressed in terms of dielectric constants, so the surface-bearing   properties of Martian soil could be better evaluated. Generally,   he believed too much stress was being placed on visual images at   the 100-meter scale and not enough on radar, which could indicate   surface irregularities at the 10-centimeter scale. He pointed   out:</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is perfectly possible for a candidate   landing site to be smooth at 100 meters and rough at 10 cm. or   vice versa. Cases of both sort of anticorrelation are common   enough on Earth. It has been alleged that at least in studies of   the Moon there is an excellent connection between roughness at 15   cm and roughness at 150 meters. A detailed statistical study of   such correlation should be prepared and subjected to critical   scrutiny. The [U.S. Geological Survey] seems to be the obvious   organization to prepare such a studyÉHowever even if such   correlations exist for the Moon, it is by no means clear that they   exist for Mars. A similar study should be performed for the Earth.   This can readily he done by cross-correlating Apollo and Gemini   photography of the Earth with radar studies.... Until such a   connection is clearly shown for the Earth-and I have grave doubts   that such a strong correlation exists-we would be foolhardy to   attach very much weight to the 100 meter appearance of candidate   landing sites on Mars.

The possibility of water and the geographical   differences between the polar and equatorial zones were the two   reasons some of the scientists favored landing in the northern   latitudes.

"If we   do decide to do a polar mission. We have a majority decision....to   recommend a site at 73&#176;N to you." Liquid water was the   nagging question.

Finally. site selection should be based only on   scientific, cost, schedule, and risk considerations-not on policy   constraints. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.58">58</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">While Naugle and Fletcher were puzzling   over a polar landing site, the Viking scientists were changing   their minds about the north. The more they talked about liquid   water at higher latitudes, the more they thought about the low   temperatures they would find there. Could they expect living   organisms to survive during the transient appearance of liquid   water as that compound passed from the solid to the vapor form or   vice versa? Biologist Wolf Vishniac had looked into that question   during February but had not turned up any evidence to support the   belief that bacteria could grow or survive at temperatures much   below -12&#176;C. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.59">59</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> Studies made with the Mariner 9 infrared   interferometer spectrometer had disclosed surface temperatures   ranging from -123&#176;C at the north polar region to +2&#176;C   near the equator. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.60">60</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> The search for unfrozen, active life forms in the   northern latitudes on Mars seemed unrealistic.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">On 2 April, Lederberg conceded that   73&#176;N no longer appeared to be a rational goal.

Long hours of   discussion followed, during which the working group voted not once   but several times on where to send the Viking spacecraft. Site 3   (19.5&#176;N, 34&#176;) was selected as the primary target for the   first lander, and site 11 (20&#176;N, 252&#176;) was chosen as the   backup.

One of the complicating factors had been the   continuous stream of new knowledge about Mars.

However, he thought that the biologists and organic   chemists had not thought through the landing site question; they   had to be educated about the nature of the planet and the   spacecraft's capabilities. According to Masursky, some of the   scientists developed many of their ideas as the debates went   along, and they were forced to analyze quickly new facts at the   table. The photogeologist recalled that while Tom Young and Jim   Martin had kept pressing the working group for timely decisions,   the managers had obviously understood the need for extended debate   and had never tried to stifle interchange of ideas. Young and   Martin, despite all kinds of external pressure, had managed to   protect the scientific integrity of the landing site working   group. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.63">63</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Results of the landing site search were   made public on 7 May 1973. John Naugle announced that a valley   near the mouth of the six-kilometer- deep "Martian Grand Canyon"   was the target for the first lander. Known as Chryse, the region   had been named for the classical land of gold or saffron of which   the Greeks had written. If all went well, Naugle told the   assembled press corps, the first Viking would be set down on or   about the Fourth of July 1976. The backup to the Chryse site was   Tritonis Lacus, Lake of Triton named for the legendary river in   Tunisia visited by Jason and the Argonauts. The second Viking was   targeted for Cydonia, named for a town in Crete, with Alba, the   White Region, as backup. Soffen told the press that NASA hoped   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Viking 1 </FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> would be heading for a very safe but interesting   target. The scientists had decided early that the first site   should be sought in the northern hemisphere (because it would be   Martian summer there), at the lowest elevation possible (higher   atmospheric pressure and better chance of water in some form), on   the flattest, least obstructed region they could find (for landing   safety and weather observations). But the second mission had been   a different story. The biologists wanted water, and after much   debate and study they hoped to find it in the 40&#176; to 55&#176;   north latitudes. Their Mission B sites were just above   44&#176;.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">But what about these specific sites? What   were they really like? Hal Masursky spoke to this point. From the   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mariner 9 </FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> photographs, he could demonstrate that about 50   percent of the planet was pockmarked with large craters not unlike   the southern highlands of the moon. "We think this is the ancient   crust of Mars that was differentiated very earlyÉand continued to   be bombarded by cosmic debris...." Large basins on the planet   recorded that epoch. The largest basin, Hellas, was nearly twice   the size of the Mare Imbrium, a giant lunar crater 676 kilometers   in diameter. To the north, the planet appeared to be smoother and   younger, and scientifically more interesting. Chryse was at the   point where a number of "stream" channels appeared to empty onto a   plain (Chryse Planitia). Essentially featureless in the Mariner   A-frame photographs, there was reason to believe that the area   [<A NAME="315"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">315</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;was covered   by fine wind-borne materials. The photogeologists believed that   there was a likelihood of finding fossil water   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="#st49">*******</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> in this region, since highland materials would have   been deposited here during earlier epochs of water-caused erosion.   According to Masursky, "It looks like....the Mars environment has   been different enough so that there was surface flowage of   enormous amount of water....into this great northern basin, and   our landing site is at the mouth of that great channel system."   The B site, Cydonia, combined the greatest chance of atmospheric   water with a low, smooth plain. Masursky thought that this was an   optimal landing target. Whereas the first area saw the drainage of   the highlands materials, the second site, near a large volcanic   complex, was covered with basalt flows partly blanketed by   wind-blown debris. "We think this combination of sites gives us   the best possibility of fossil and present water, and our best   samples to test the evolution of the planet." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="sources9.html#9.64">64</A></FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Selection of the Viking landing sites   based on the data available in 1973 was only a first step toward   ensuring safe havens for the spacecraft on Mars, and the Viking   scientists recognized that additional data should be obtained from   Earth-based radar observations and Viking orbital photography.   Still, the work of the landing site working group provided the   foundation for subsequent debate about the safety of the two   Viking landers. The second phase of the landing site story focuses   on the certification of the chosen sites, a process that started   in May 1973 and was still going on hours before the landers were   released for descent to the Red Planet. As is so often true of   first steps, site selection was the initiation to a more   bewildering process-landing site certification.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>   <A NAME="st43"></A></FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">*</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Other members   of the working group were C.
