The 2.0 equivalent to thinking aloud to brainstorm an idea :)<br /><br />Antennas tend to be parabolic because they make the waves converge at the same time in one point, hence amplifying the physical signals of the whole area of the antena instead of just hearing those coming to one point. I can remember some EM interferometry (radio, IR, visible, UV), but I was thinking now about the equivalent with pressure waves (sound).<br /><br /><b>What if you put a flat 2D array of microphones?</b><br /><br /><i>If the sound comes from far away, in front</i> <br />The pressure waves are flat and arrive to the mics at the same time. You just need to sum up the digital signals from each mic to interferometrically capture the sound from that point. The rest of signals will tend to cancel out. You can even misalign/cover a few and subtract them from the signal to remove some of the background noise and electronic/thermal pedestal. &quot;Far&quot; means compared to the distance between mics.<br /><br /><i>If the sound comes from far away, but on the side</i><br />Same thing as above, but before summing up the signals, introduce the delay of the pressure waves travelling the extra distance to the next mic. Tuning the delay you can point your beam and listen to a particular direction. The <b>cool</b> thing is that you can do this delays via software, so you can virtually point at multiple directions <b>at the same time</b>. They do this in radioastronomy with radio signals.<br /><br /><i>If the sounds comes from a close source</i><br />Same thing just tune the offset to each node in the mic array to match the propagation of the arrival of the wave. E.g. If it comes from straight in front, tune it from the center outwards.<br /><br />You could then virtually tune your ear <b>simultaneously to any and all</b> points in the 3D space, live or just re-playing the sounds.<br /><br />More coolness, you can further tune the ear in frequency using digital Fourier transforms. For example the frequency of a car engine, of human voice, ...<br /><br /><b>Resolution</b><br />The angular resolution of the ear, would be roughly the projected distance between mics and, say, a quarter (peak to valley) of the wavelength.<br /><br />The temporal resolution, for off-axis sources, would be the accuracy by which you can shift the digital signals in time (and the Nyquist frequency of the sampling).<br /><br />With light, the speed is so fast (c) that it makes temporal shifts hard and mostly non digital), also the frequency makes the arrays to be huge (radio) or tiny (UV). Audible sounds waves are 20-20k Hz. Seems a range software could handle well. About the speed (function of density but roughly 300m/s) not sure what implies in terms of the array dimensions... but now that I think of it, I remember geologist use arrays of mics to detect ultrasonic echoes to measure crust and mantle topology...<br /><br />Thoughts? I need to mull this a bit over before deciding is nonsense or worth a little more research...</div></div><div class="kt"></div></div></div><div class="Lj FE"><div class="fC YQ"></div><div class="Se Eu"><div class="ak XQ df" style="display:none"><div class="iP"><span role="button" class="a-n-E WQ" tabindex="0"><span class="gh Ni">1</span><span class="Oi"> comment</span></span></div></div><div class="O7 mP"><div class="Hq uz"><span role="button" class="a-n Qn VQ" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Unused plural form</span><div class="Gq"><div id="z12rf3j54mq0h5z2i22esn0itva4hjgi004#1335183292342541" tabindex="-1" class="Ho gx"><div class="Ae"><a href="./106437074792002603331"class="g-s-n-aa Wk"oid="106437074792002603331"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-a1ueYVYYdVU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/zp1lvt1zzTs/s32-c-k/photo.jpg" width="32px" height="32px"alt=""class="Ol Zb ag"oid="106437074792002603331"></a><div ><article><a href="./106437074792002603331" class="Sg Ob qm" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="106437074792002603331">DVD PS</a><span class="Fw"><span class="Uy Du"></span><span class="N7 lP"><div class="Np On yL a-f-e"></div></span></span><div class="Mi">I&#39;m almost sure LOFAR (<a href="http://www.lofar.ie" class="ot-anchor">http://www.lofar.ie</a> <a href="http://www.lofar.org" class="ot-anchor">http://www.lofar.org</a>) produces the delays by software with a digitalise signal...
