Chapter 31</h3>
  
      <h3 class="attention">Scientific &amp; Technological Community</h3>
      <h3 class="uppercase">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <div class="hr" style="width:480px;"><hr /></div>
      
      <p>31.1. The present chapter focuses on how to enable the scientific and
      technological community, which includes, among others, engineers,
      architects, industrial designers, urban planners and other professionals
      and policy makers, to make a more open and effective contribution to the
      decision-making processes concerning environment and development. It is
      important that the role of science and technology in human affairs be more
      widely known and better understood, both by decision makers who help
      determine public policy and by the general public. The cooperative
      relationship existing between the scientific and technological community
      and the general public should be extended and deepened into a full
      partnership. Improved communication and cooperation between the scientific
      and technological community and decision makers will facilitate greater
      use of scientific and technical information and knowledge in policies and
      programme implementation. Decision makers should create more favourable
      conditions for improving training and independent research in sustainable
      development. Existing multidisciplinary approaches will have to be
      strengthened and more interdisciplinary studies developed between the
      scientific and technological community and policy makers and with the
      general public to provide leadership and practical know-how to the concept
      of sustainable development. The public should be assisted in communicating
      their sentiments to the scientific and technological community concerning
      how science and technology might be better managed to affect their lives
      in a beneficial way. By the same token, the independence of the scientific
      and technological community to investigate and publish without restriction
      and to exchange their findings freely must be assured. The adoption and
      implementation of ethical principles and codes of practice for the
      scientific and technological community that are internationally accepted
      could enhance professionalism and may improve and hasten recognition of
      the value of its contributions to environment and development, recognizing
      the continuing evolution and uncertainty of scientific knowledge.</p>
      <h3 class="uppercase">PROGRAMME AREAS</h3>
      <div class="hr"><hr /></div>
      <h3 class="uppercase">A. Improving communication and cooperation among the
      scientific and technological community, decision makers and the public</h3>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Basis for action</h4>
      <p>31.2. The scientific and technological community and policy makers
      should increase their interaction in order to implement strategies for
      sustainable development on the basis of the best available knowledge. This
      implies that decision makers should provide the necessary framework for
      rigorous research and for full and open communication of the findings of
      the scientific and technological community, and develop with it ways in
      which research results and the concerns stemming from the findings can be
      communicated to decision-making bodies so as to better link scientific and
      technical knowledge with strategic policy and programme formulation. At
      the same time, this dialogue would assist the scientific and technological
      community in developing priorities for research and proposing actions for
      constructive solutions.</p>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Objectives</h4>
      <p>31.3. The following objectives are proposed:
      </p><blockquote>
        <p>(a) To extend and open up the decision-making process and broaden the
          range of developmental and environmental issues where cooperation at
          all levels between the scientific and technological community and
          decision makers can take place;</p>
        <p>(b) To improve the exchange of knowledge and concerns between the
          scientific and technological community and the general public in order
          to enable policies and programmes to be better formulated, understood
          and supported.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Activities</h4>
      <p>31.4. Governments should undertake the following activities:
      </p><blockquote>
        <p>(a) Review how national scientific and technological activities could be
          more responsive to sustainable development needs as part of an overall
          effort to strengthen national research and development systems,
          including through strengthening and widening the membership of
          national scientific and technological advisory councils, organizations
          and committees to ensure that:</p>
          <ol class="ivx">
            <li>The full range of national needs for scientific and
              technological programmes are communicated to Governments and the
              public;
            </li><li>The various strands of public opinion are represented;</li>
          </ol>
        <p>(b) Promote regional cooperative mechanisms to address regional needs
          for sustainable development. Such regional cooperative mechanisms
          could be facilitated through public/private partnerships and provide
          support to Governments, industry, non-governmental educational
          institutions and other domestic and international organizations, and
          by strengthening global professional networks;
        </p><p>(c) Improve and expand scientific and technical inputs through
          appropriate mechanisms to intergovernmental consultative, cooperative
          and negotiating processes towards international and regional
          agreements;
        </p><p>(d) Strengthen science and technology advice to the highest levels of
          the United Nations, and other international institutions, in order to
          ensure the inclusion of science and technology know-how in sustainable
          development policies and strategies;
        </p><p>(e) Improve and strengthen programmes for disseminating research results
          of universities and research institutions. This requires recognition
          of and greater support to the scientists, technologists and teachers
          who are engaged in communicating and interpreting scientific and
          technological information to policy makers, professionals in other
          fields and the general public. Such support should focus on the
          transfer of skills and the transfer and adaptation of planning
          techniques. This requires full and open sharing of data and
          information among scientists and decision makers. The publication of
          national scientific research reports and technical reports that are
          understandable and relevant to local sustainable development needs
          would also improve the interface between science and decision-making,
          as well as the implementation of scientific results;
        </p><p>(f) Improve links between the official and independent research sectors
          and industry so that research may become an important element of
          industrial strategy;
        </p><p>(g) Promote and strengthen the role of women as full partners in the
          science and technology disciplines;
        </p><p>(h) Develop and implement information technologies to enhance the
          dissemination of information for sustainable development.
      </p></blockquote>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Means of implementation</h4>
      <h4>A) Financing and cost evaluation</h4>
      <p>31.5. The Conferense secretariat has estimated the average total annual
      cost (1993-2000) of implementing the activities of this programme to be
      about $15 million from the international community on grant or
      concessional terms. These are indicative and order-of-magnitude estimates
      only and have not been reviewed by Governments. Actual costs and financial
      terms, including any that are non-concessional, will depend upon, inter
      alia, the specific strategies and programmes Governments decide upon for
      implementation.</p>
      <h4>B) Capacity-building</h4>
      <p>31.6. Intergovernmental panels on development and environmental issues
      should be organized, with emphasis on their scientific and technical
      aspects, and studies of responsiveness and adaptability included in
      subsequent programmes of action.</p>
      <div class="hr"><hr /></div>
      <h3 class="uppercase">B. Promoting codes of practice and guidelines related
      to science and technology</h3>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Basis for action</h4>
      <p>31.7. Scientists and technologists have a special set of
      responsibilities which belong to them both as inheritors of a tradition
      and as professionals and members of disciplines devoted to the search for
      knowledge and to the need to protect the biosphere in the context of
      sustainable development.</p>
      <p>31.8. Increased ethical awareness in environmental and developmental
      decision-making should help to place appropriate priorities for the
      maintenance and enhancement of life-support systems for their own sake,
      and in so doing ensure that the functioning of viable natural processes is
      properly valued by present and future societies. Therefore, a
      strengthening of the codes of practice and guidelines for the scientific
      and technological community would increase environmental awareness and
      contribute to sustainable development. It would build up the level of
      esteem and regard for the scientific and technological community and
      facilitate the "accountability" of science and technology.</p>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Objectives</h4>
      <p>31.9. The objective should be to develop, improve and promote
      international acceptance of codes of practice and guidelines relating to
      science and technology in which the integrity of life-support systems is
      comprehensively accounted for and where the important role of science and
      technology in reconciling the needs of environment and development is
      accepted. To be effective in the decision-making process, such principles,
      codes of practice and guidelines must not only be agreed upon by the
      scientific and technological community, but also recognized by the society
      as a whole.</p>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Activities</h4>
      <p>31.10. The following activities could be undertaken:
      </p><blockquote>
        <p>(a) Strengthening national and international cooperation, including the
          non-governmental sector, to develop codes of practice and guidelines
          regarding environmentally sound and sustainable development, taking
          into account the Rio Declaration and existing codes of practice and
          guidelines;</p>
        <p>(b) Strengthening and establishing national advisory groups on
          environmental and developmental ethics, in order to develop a common
          value framework between the scientific and technological community and
          society as a whole, and promote continuous dialogue;
        </p><p>(c) Extending education and training in developmental and environmental
          ethical issues to integrate such objectives into education curricula
          and research priorities;
        </p><p>(d) Reviewing and amending relevant national and international
          environment and development legal instruments to ensure appropriate
          codes of practice and guidelines are incorporated into such regulatory
          machinery.
      </p></blockquote>
      <h4 class="uppercase">Means of implementation</h4>
      <h4>A) Financing and cost evaluation</h4>
      <p>31.11. The Conferense secretariat has estimated the average total
      annual cost (1993-2000) of implementing the activities of this programme
      to be about $5 million from the international community on grant or
      concessional terms. These are indicative and order-of-magnitude estimates
      only and have not been reviewed by Governments. Actual costs and financial
      terms, including any that are non-concessional, will depend upon, inter
      alia, the specific strategies and programmes Governments decide upon for
      implementation.</p>
      <h4>B) Capacity-building</h4>
      <p>31.12. Codes of practice and guidelines, including on appropriate
      principles, should be developed for and by the scientific and
      technological community in the pursuit of its research activities and
      implementation of programmes aimed at sustainable development.
