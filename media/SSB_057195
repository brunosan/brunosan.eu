Notable successes such as the Apollo program and the Hubble Space Telescope<span> </span>have stimulated broad public excitement and a feeling of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; with NASA&rsquo;s science and exploration programs. A recent perception, however, is that there are fewer successes than in the past. One major reason for this perception may be that many of NASA&rsquo;s missions now take years to develop to the point where noteworthy milestones occur or significant results begin to appear. For example, the International Space Station has taken more than 20 years from President Reagan&rsquo;s initial announcement to the achievement of &ldquo;Assembly Complete,&rdquo; and the James Webb Space Telescope, widely seen as the successor to Hubble, will have been under development for at least 15 years by the time of its scheduled launch in 2014.&nbsp;Continuously involving the public and conveying the value and excitement of missions during their long development periods can be daunting.&nbsp;If such efforts are not successful, there is a risk that dramatic loss of public interest will result.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Space Studies Board&rsquo;s 2010 Workshop will explore both how these grand questions focus of the nation's space research program and how best to convey the value and excitement so generated, to the public.&nbsp; The workshop will feature invited presentations and session discussions on the aforementioned five &ldquo;Grand&rdquo; Questions.&rdquo;&nbsp;Public understanding of the discoveries and achievements of the past 50 years and public interest and involvement in potential achievements and NASA activities in space science and exploration and will be addressed.&nbsp;Lesson learned, from the communications and social marketing sector at large will also be considered.&nbsp;Sessions addressing &ldquo;Inspiring Public Interest in Space Research and Exploration: Communication Challenges and Opportunities&rdquo; and &ldquo;Communication Pathways to the Public: Readable Content, Video, and Social Media&rdquo; will focus on sustaining public understanding of, interest in, and involvement with NASA science and exploration efforts that might take several years to decades to unfold.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Following the event, the NRC will produce and release a summary of the workshop proceedings.</div><div><br clear="all" /><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /><div id="ftn1"><div><a class=" FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC" title="" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"><span><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> The impetus for many of these missions stems from recommendations from National Research Council decadal surveys.&nbsp;A new set of such surveys now underway will provide the basis for mission planning for the decade to come and beyond.&nbsp;NASA is working on programs to advance the next phase of human space exploration.</div></div><div id="ftn2"><div><a class=" FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC FCK__AnchorC" title="" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"><span><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></span></a> NASA is working on programs to advance the next phase of human space exploration.</div></div></div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p align="center" style="text-align: left"><strong><a name="Statement_of_Task"></a>Statement of Task</strong></p><p align="center" style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left"><a target="" href="javascript:linkToNative('SSB_057527')">Read the Statement of Task for &quot;Sharing the Adventure with the Public&quot;</a></p><p align="center" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p><p align="center" style="text-align: left"><strong><a name="Agenda"></a>Agenda</strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: left"><strong><a target="" href="javascript:linkToNative('SSB_058238')">CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD AGENDA</a></strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a name="Confirmed_Speaker_and_Moderator"></a>Confirmed Speaker <em>(S)&nbsp;</em>and Moderator <em>(M)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bios and PRESENTATIONS</strong></p><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" width="800" border="0"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>&nbsp;<img height="156" alt="Steve Benner headshot" width="124" src="/xpedio/groups/ssbsite/documents/webgraphics/ssb_057501.jpg" />&nbsp;</p></td><td><p><a target="" href="http://www.ffame.org/people/sbenner.html">Steve Benner</a>, <em>Distinguished Fellow</em>, Florida Foundation of Applied Molecular Evotion <em>(S)</em></p><p><a target="" href="javascript:linkToNative('SSB_059681')">View Steve's presentation from Session 3</a></p><div>Dr. Steven A.
