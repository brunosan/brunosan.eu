<div class="float_right"><iframe width="300" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iy7sbagRV-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> For our current campaign, we have chosen to support <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières</a>, a neutral international humanitarian organization dedicated to providing need based care. They work in areas devastated by natural disasters and armed conflict, plagued with epidemics, or are otherwise lacking in adequate health care. Their work is ongoing and directed to regions that need help the most.

<P>From their website:<br>
<i>MSF's work is based on the humanitarian principles of medical ethics and impartiality. The organization is committed to bringing quality medical care to people in crisis regardless of their race, religion, or political affiliation.

<p>MSF operates independently of any political, military, or religious agendas. Medical teams conduct evaluations on the ground to determine a population's medical needs before opening programs, aiming to fill gaps that exist (rather than replicating services that are already offered) or reach communities that are not being assisted.

<p>In 2009, MSF medical teams carried out more than 7.5 million outpatient consultations; delivered 110,000 babies; treated 1.1 million people for malaria; treated 200,000 severely and moderately malnourished children; provided 165,000 people living with HIV/AIDS with antiretroviral therapy; vaccinated 7.9 million people against meningitis; and conducted 50,000 surgeries.</i>

<P>Doctors Without Borders relies on private donations for 90% of their funding. All donations that the Richard Dawkins Foundation receives via Non-Believers Giving Aid will be donated to Doctors Without Borders - nothing is removed for overhead. Please help us with whatever you are able to give.
