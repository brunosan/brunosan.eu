<B>Ants display collectively intelligent behavior</B> when
foraging for food or fighting off predators.  
Each ant in the colony acts in a rather simple
way, but together they end up doing something clever, like
discovering the shortest path between their ant hill
and a food source.
MUTE's routing mechanism is inspired by ant behavior.<BR>

<B>JROC's Windows-only MUTE App</B> (new version 0.0.2 available)<BR>
JROC has developed an MFC-based Windows user interface for MUTE File Sharing (in other words, a Windows MUTE node that does not use wxWindows).  
The MFC release is nicely designed (with beautiful tab icons) and may be worth using if you spend a lot of time using MUTE on Windows.<BR>
