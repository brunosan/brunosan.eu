<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think the poster might be a little naive about the H1-B process and how unattractive it is for small companies. Make no bones about it. Its a major hassle, and if you leave it to the company it will (usually) never happen.<p>So advice for people in the same boat in the future, If it is something you really want to do, then you need to know <i>exactly</i> how the process works at every step of the way and also have a really good Lawyer that the company can talk to if they have questions. They can help you if tricky things come up (and they will if the company applying for you is small enough).<p>I advise you not to go with a lawyer from a big firm, those guys just want to see dollars ... and if your case is small and tricky they will not be interested. trust me.  Try to find an individual or small firm that is responsive and knows the ins and outs of the process far better than you ... if possible ask them to tell you the trickiest situation they've helped a client with before ... that should give you some idea of how good they are. Usually they can bill you for their time spent talking the company, or their lawyer down from the ledge (this will happen), or if they handle the process then you or the company can pay their fees.<p>Lay out the process when the company asks about it (because they will usually not know), let them know that its not complex, just a pain in the ass and that you will handle most of the legwork (you're prepared to do this right?) ... some people chip in to help with the fees if they're so inclined ... this is frowned upon and I think the law has been changed to make it illegal, use that information as you want.<p>Above all, be persistent, upbeat and constantly in touch, do not think that a company is going to jump through hoops to pay $5000 to get you. And remember that some of the requests that are made of the company (like tax returns etc) might cause them to stall, so be prepared for that.<p>It will come down to how bad you want it.
good luck</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3425495 href="vote?for=3425495&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%34%32%34%38%36%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3425495></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=droithomme">droithomme</a> 179 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3425495">link</a></span></div><br>

If f(x) = x^2 - N, then you're looking for the (positive) zero of f.  You take a succession of tangent lines and look at the zeros of those.  So, you start with a guess (call it x_0), take the tangent line at your guess (so it has slope 2x_0 and goes through (x_0, x_0^2 -N)), then find the x-intercept of this line and make it your new guess.  This is all Newton's method is.

This is just Newton's method to find a solution of the equation a^2 - x = 0.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Read again what I wrote: there exist jobs that require knowledge of Newton's method, and in those cases this would be a valid interview question. This is not in disagreement with your "there exist jobs that do not require knowledge of Newton's method". You're likely to need to know about Newton's method for jobs in the area of machine learning, robot control, or some kind of physics simulation.<p>That said, Newton's method is not rocket science. The basic algorithm is iterating this line:<p><pre><code>    z = z - f(z)/f'(z)
</code></pre>
Where f is some function and f' is its derivative. In many cases this will rapidly converge to a root of f (i.e. z will converge such that f(z) = 0). As far as algorithms go, this one is pretty damn simple. It is not in my working memory either, and I expect that many people rederive it when they need it.<p>The idea behind Newton's algorithm is that you approximate the function f(x) with the tangent line L at z:<p><pre><code>    L(x) = A + B*(x-z)
    with A = f(z) and B = f'(z)
</code></pre>
Now L(x) is an approximation of f(x). How well an approximation this is depends on how much f(x) looked like a line in the first place. Then instead of solving f(x) = 0 (which is our goal, but hard) you solve L(x) = 0 (which is not exactly our goal but almost our goal, and it is easy). So:<p><pre><code>    f(z) + f'(z)(x-z) = 0
</code></pre>
Rewriting:<p><pre><code>    x = z - f(z)/f'(z)
</code></pre>
Now the approximation of f(x) at that x is 0. Because it's only an approximation to f(x) it will probably not make the real f(x) = 0. Therefore we apply the method again and again with x as the new starting point:<p><pre><code>   z = some starting value
   until f(z) is small enough:
      z = z - f(z)/f'(z)
</code></pre>
Because we're iterating, this method works even if f(x) doesn't look much like a line. For example x^2 - a doesn't look much like a line, but Newton's method is very effective at computing its root to compute sqrt. To see how outrageously effective it is, lets compute sqrt(2.0) with it. Lets start with a starting guess x = 1.0. We get the following numbers:<p><pre><code>    iteration    x
    ---------    -
    1            1.0
    2            1.5
    3            1.416666666666666
    4            1.414215686274509
    5            1.414213562374689
    6            1.414213562373095
    7            1.414213562373095
</code></pre>
Note that at the 6th iteration already all 16 digits are correct.<p>Newton's method is perhaps the most beautiful algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness, and worth knowing even if only for its beauty. It is also quite probably the most important algorithm ever invented. It is used everywhere from division in hardware to optimizing all kinds of things and solving differential equations.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3426252 href="vote?for=3426252&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%34%32%34%38%36%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3426252></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=maeon3">maeon3</a> 179 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3426252">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>tl;dr; - Too many good people have 'portfolios' that they can't legally show me; until that changes, I have to ask people to code on a whiteboard.<p>Here's the more nuanced version (in which I largely agree with jnbiche):<p>The stuff listed in that article under "An Alternative" describes the exact tech interview I used to give. And we had several people pass it with flying colors who we later had to let go because they couldn't actually translate a requirement into code.<p>So we adjusted our interview to make sure that people had the ability to write basic code. I'm not talking about stupid puzzles or API quizzes. I'm talking about 'show me you understand what recursion is'. I'm talking about 'given a detailed description of the FizzBuzz problem, can you write me a loop (in any language; pseudocode is fine, too) that outputs the right answer? And can you adjust your code if I change the requirements slightly?' Stuff that anyone who codes on a daily basis should be able to breeze through.<p>This was dead-easy stuff. Just me and the candidate in a room - there wasn't a giant audience, there was not ticking clock, and I was explaining the algorithms. And again, quite a few people could not do it.<p>If they could do it, we moved on to the original interview where I asked about technology, past projects, etc. Some people didn't pass that part of the interview.<p>Believe me, we were stoked when we got a candidate who listed open-source projects on a resume or brought it up in the interview, because we got to see real-world code that the candidate had written. But that was a relatively rare occurrence.<p>This brings me to the crux of the 'until other, better signals of ability are widely available' comment. I think it's widely agreed (at least, in a place like HN) that code is the best signal of ability. But there are many, many candidates who write excellent code that no one outside of their company will (or even legally can) ever see. If I turned away candidates just because they didn't have a github account, I would have missed out on some of the greatest coders I ever worked with. There are plenty of people who passionately write excellent software every day, but who do so under NDA. They may not work on OS projects in their off time because they may not have any (or they have kids, or other time-consuming hobbies).<p>So for a lot of fantastic coders, the best possible signal of their ability is not publicly available. I would even go as far as to suggest that this <i>may</i> be true for the majority of fantastic coders. Everyone has to pay the bills, which means 8 hours of writing custom business software for a lot of people. I know for a fact that some of the best stuff I've ever written is buried with companies that failed, never to see the light of day. I can't show that in an interview. How many other people are in the same boat? <a href="http://xkcd.com/664/" rel="nofollow">http://xkcd.com/664/</a><p>Obviously, one huge part of the solution to this problem is for companies to open-source their code. That movement has already begun; lots of successful companies have come to the realization that keeping their code 'secret' has no value while allowing outside review and contribution has immense value. And some smart companies which use a lot of open-source tools and libraries are paying their employees to contribute bug fixes and features. Those trends are starting to address the 'widely available' part of my comment, and the day may eventually come where employers can simply throw away resumes which don't have any links to code contributions. In fact, if you're looking for another bullet point on your presentation to your employer about "why we should do open source", I would suggest mentioning the hiring benefits to the entire community.<p>But until we hit that critical mass, I'm still going to have to ask people to implement n-factorial on a whiteboard.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3427711 href="vote?for=3427711&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%34%32%34%38%36%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3427711></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=davidw">davidw</a> 179 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3427711">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I actually do know offhand that I use the Taylor series to calculate it, and that the Carmack method works by using a couple tricks of binary floating point format to do a really good starting point and then run the Taylor series through a single round of iteration. I've also implemented it myself before since library methods were too slow. This probably puts me in the top 0.001% of developers world wide in terms of what I happen to have memorized and from personal experience about square roots. However, I don't offhand remember the details at all and wouldn't pretend to. I would never use this an an interview question because it doesn't test for anything at all. 99% of candidates would have no clue regardless of skill level, and of the 1% who knew anything, most would be because they happened to study the right "interview tricks" site while cramming for the interview.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This thread depresses me; I just read every comment.<p>As an American, the visa stuff makes me sad, because it tells me that the system is broken. But what really gets to me, as a newbie developer, is the interview and hiring commentary. It makes me feel like there's just no hope for somebody like me-- I don't have a CS degree and come from the world of humanities and liberal arts. The furthest I went with math in Uni was Discrete. I don't take tests well, and I'm no good with heavy duty algorithmic methodology (though I do know some of them). I don't have any formulae memorized. I tend to think of programming like I do writing: I have great grammar, punctuation, and spelling.<p>I'm afraid I would fail miserably at these gauntlet-style tests applied by big SV companies. I love technology and I love building things and what I'm doing now, but the path of achievement and improvement professionally from novice to indispensible pro often seems cloudy to me. I think our culture needs to spend more time and money on apprenticeship and helping less experienced developers reach that next rung on the ladder.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This often baffles me, as a foreigner in America (currently in a position where I occasionally hire people).<p>The American employee is probably the least protected in the West. Firing is about as simple &#38; cheap as it gets outside of an Indonesian sweatshop. Many start as contractors anyway. The upside should have been that companies would be quicker to hire. Instead sprung a weird culture of "the four hour interview" (sometimes several of these).<p>There's actually not that much you can find out about someone before hiring them: "Show me a piece of code you've written" - hopefully it's on GitHub or similar, ideally forked by some other people too - "Tell me about some design decisions you made when building this". You should also try to gauge personality, motivation, curiosity and chemistry.<p>That's about all you'll know, regardless of how convoluted your process. But fortunately you're not in France, so if it doesn't work out you can always go your separate ways.<p>When companies take too long to hire it usually indicates fear of making decisions. Interviewers are afraid to say someone's a good/bad fit. The CTO is afraid to look bad for hiring the wrong person. It's probably not going to be a fun place to work if you want to create new things.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3425152 href="vote?for=3425152&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%34%32%34%38%36%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3425152></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Brajeshwar">Brajeshwar</a> 179 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3425152">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Having remote workers requires a very different operation style and a lot of trust in yourself as a manager, trust in your workers, and trust in the technology you're leveraging to communicate. Can you as the manager lead from afar -- its harder than you might think. You can trust workers to actually work, you can just let them go for not doing so. But it's harder to trust your remote workers to engage with the company and their peers digitally. It's not easy. Also, the technology may be a pain to use, and kill any good intentions or habits you may have started.<p>The similar problem with remote is that the manager and their team must consciously prevent the "silence" the author alluded too. Likely, the silence was not intentional. People get distracted in "realspace" and easily can neglect remote worker. In order to have a remote team be viable, you have to overcome this barrier. That's where the trust/competence of all parties comes into play.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3426501 href="vote?for=3426501&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%34%32%34%38%36%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3426501></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=smallblacksun">smallblacksun</a> 179 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3426501">link</a></span></div><br>
