<h2>Projects</h2>

Most of the work I do has no public restrictions, and I always try to
release it whenever I feel it could be of help for others. I also like to learn new
skills, and I appreciate when people take the time to upload their
progress and challenges.


Here is a summary of some of the projects IÂ´ve been doing in the past
years that have some associated public material. Should you have any
questions or want to collaborate with any of these, let me know!


<div id="projects">
  {% include projects_header.html %} 
  
  {% for project in site.categories.project %}

    {% include projects_line.html %} 

  {% endfor %}


  {% include projects_footer.html %} 
</div>

<div id="skillstag">
<h3>Projects by skill</h3>
<div id="skill-cloud">
  <ol>
  {% for skill in site.skills %}
  {% assign skilllist = skill[1] %}
  {% case skilllist.size %}
      {% when 1 %}
      {% assign class="not-popular" %}
      {% when 2 %}
      {% assign class="popular" %}
      {% when 3..9 %}
      {% assign class="very-popular" %}
      {% else %}
      {% assign class="ultra-popular" %}
  {% endcase %}
      <li class="{{ class }}"><a href="skills/{{ skill[0] | cgi_escape }}/" title="View entries skillged '{{ skill[0] }}'">{{ skill[0] }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ol>
