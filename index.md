I´m mostly interested in bridging the gaps between **Science, Technology and Society**. I´m fascinated by new technologies that empowers society, development, sustainability or crisis response. 

I´m a **scientist**. I have a [PhD](/2008/11/13/phd/) in Astrophysics. I´ve used some of the [best](/2008/07/20/ultimo-dia-en-la-vtt/) ground telescopes of the world. I also did a [Postdoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Research_Laboratory) with NASA satellites and rockets. I´ve always loved science [outreach](/tags/Outreach/). This is why I jumped the opportunity to help bring S&T closer to society when I was offered a [Mirzayan](/2010/12/09/101-days-as-science-and-technology-policy-fellow/) Fellowship at the National Academies of Sciences in 2010. I then worked to bring open data to the climate change arena when I worked as Director for Science and Technology at the NGO [Gain](http://gain.org/).

[Coding](https://github.com/brunosan) goes hand to hand with S&T. I´m an open-source open-data advocate, and I´m continuously trying to improve as a **developer**. Very honored to be finalist at the ["Apps for Development"](/2011/06/07/know-your-world-says-thank-you/) World Bank competition.

My current work is Chief Scientists at [MapBox](www.mapbox.com). We are pushing what´s possible  with geolocation services, mapping and satellite images all with open data and open software.

In 2013 I was awarded "[Young Global Leader](/2013/03/12/young-global-leader-2013/)" by the World Economic Forum.

I consider myself a inquisitive open-minded person, advocating for a better world where Science, Technology and Society get to understand better each other. We live amazing times, where we are exposed to much more information, where we can reach much further and where making change, *being the change*, is easier than ever. Huge chances for a better world are possible... Also,  chances for the worse are also possible. Technology makes us lazy, procrastinators and dependent. I see both Science and Technology as tools. Tools for welfare, for development, for leverage, for a better tomorrow. It´s up to **us**. Now, more than ever, we (all of us) are responsible for the future, and our actions are indeed votes for the world we want to live in. Dare not to join?
