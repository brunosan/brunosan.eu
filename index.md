Hi! Welcome to my personal page.

I'm program director of Microsoft's ["AI for Earth"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth). Our group is building the “[Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/)”. 

I'm a PhD in Astrophysics, and rocket science postdoc. I led Big Data innovation at the World Bank Innovation Labs, served as VP Social Impact at the satellite company Satellogic and Chief Scientist at Mapbox. I wrote a book too. Available for free [here](https://book.impactscience.dev), but also on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SN1L4L2/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1). It's abut the role of science and research for social and environmental Impact. Basically shifting our knowledge-based value system to one skills-based, and figuring out how to best deploy it. I was awarded Mirzayan Science Policy Fellow of the US National Academies of Science and a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum. All in all, *Non vi, saepe cadendo*.


From Asturias (Spain), currently living in the Seattle area.
