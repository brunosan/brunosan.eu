		<title>Scientific value ≠ Perception of the scientific value</title>
		<link href="/scientific-value-%25e2%2589%25a0-perception-of-the-scientific-value"/>
		<updated>2012-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
		<id>/scientific-value-%e2%89%a0-perception-of-the-scientific-value</id>
		<content type="html">A russian satellite makes a time lapse of the Earth from space. A truly beautiful video.
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6twFHqJ03_k]

This reminds me of a text I read many years ago: Carl Sagan was defending the inclusion of visual cameras in scientific payloads, even when the scientific value would be arguable.

&lt;!--more--&gt;Researchers were claiming on the extra weight and limited value, and longevity, of such an instrument, versus the many other things they could put to measure wind speed, chemical composition, ...

Carl Sagan´s point was that we need to &lt;strong&gt;connect with society&lt;/strong&gt;, to the humane instinct of visual exploration. It is ok to give up a little bit of extra science if we can get a better overal picture, or link with people. A single image can convey to many more people the awe and wonder of the Universe, and the need to continue the journey, than thousand papers or plots. That´s just our human nature. One of the most important things since I´ve left research is exactly that.

Almost every single weather satellite in the recent years has had the same capabilities to make this movie of the Earth. But they either chose to put only an infrared camera (needed if you want to see clouds at night) or they never thought of making this Outreach product. The russians did, and they added a camera in the near visible range to have the closest possible to &quot;a view from space&quot;. They´ve reached &lt;strong&gt;millions&lt;/strong&gt; more of &quot;wow moments&quot;. With this video we can connect to many concepts, like the importance of satellites, the concept of climate, the Earth has a unity, ...

Here´s another example with the ISS and the Earth. You might not even remember the purpose of the ISS (or even that we had humans living there since years)  but you might remember (or you will) this video:

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip2ZGND1I9Q]

Another case, from my experience: My thesis took around 3 years, and 100 days of observations at a telescope. Probably less than 20 people understand it, and I hope it be a small contribution to advance solar physic. One day, at the telescope, I made a 20 seconds video, and then I took a few hours to prepare a simple video of it (here it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bsan.eu/LbfigS&quot;&gt;http://bsan.eu/LbfigS&lt;/a&gt; ). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/113118420661689340672&quot;&gt;Astronomy Picture of the Day (APoD)&lt;/a&gt; featured it 3 times, and literally millions of people has seen it. With that video, we can engage in so many concepts of Astronomy, Optics and Solar Physics. And so have told me teachers from literally all around the world when they asked me to use it on their classroom.

The last example could well be my recent work: We did a Climate change Adaptation Index, and it took a lot of work. Once done, it would have never went very far, if we had not spent significant time and resources to make a visual tool to explore some of the messages. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://index.gain.org/&quot;&gt;index.gain.org&lt;/a&gt;)

The lesson to learn here, to me, is very clear. The &lt;strong&gt;scientific value&lt;/strong&gt; is one stop away from the &lt;strong&gt;societal perception of the scientific value&lt;/strong&gt;, which is tremendously important, and powerful. We must do that extra mile, even at the cost of some more research. &lt;em&gt;There is a painful detachment of S&amp;amp;T and society.&lt;/em&gt;

PS: I can´t remember if that Carl Sagan text was connected to the russian lander on Venus (I doubt it) or to the Viking Mars from +&lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/113315419190905475766&quot;&gt;NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. This might be part of the Cosmos book. Can´t remember or find it. This is the closest I could find. &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4212/ch9.html&quot;&gt;http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4212/ch9.html&lt;/a&gt;

		<title>Case Study for an Invitation System using Google Apps Script.</title>
		<link href="/case-study-for-an-invitation-system-using-google-apps-script"/>
		<updated>2012-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
		<id>/case-study-for-an-invitation-system-using-google-apps-script</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-18-at-5-38-35-pm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2417&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2012-05-18 at 5.38.35 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-18-at-5-38-35-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Earlier this month my NGO (&lt;a href=&quot;http://gain.org&quot;&gt;GAIN&lt;/a&gt;) had its &lt;a href=&quot;http://gain.org/annual-meeting-2012&quot;&gt;annual meeting&lt;/a&gt;. Around 200 participants, which includes several presidents, CEOs, ambassadors and representatives of the World Bank, OAS, and more than 100 companies. The invitation list to the reception had more than 1.000 names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;I built the Invitation system almost from scratch using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/apps-script/&quot;&gt;Google Apps Script&lt;/a&gt; (GAS), and I want to share the experience. The decision to engage on this was partly becasue I had the chance to participate on a free and open event about GAS for developers at the Google Washington DC offices (&lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/111752662319997528493/posts/bq7NrttcWAb&quot;&gt;thank you&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;My goal was to follow these premises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make it as simple as possible, &lt;strong&gt;for both sides&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not ask any information you know&lt;/strong&gt;. I hate filling up my name, over and over again, when they should already know it! And learn from the corrections people do on their info.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Send short, simple and &lt;strong&gt;personalized&lt;/strong&gt;, messages.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate&lt;/strong&gt;, as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I do have coding experience, but not in GAS or javascript. I estimate it was, overall, around 3 full days of coding. I did not start from a blank sheet, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/apps-script/articles/expense_report_approval&quot;&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; as my starting point. This is hardly a re-usable script as-is, but I hope it can help others build upon it. The whole GAS code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brunosan/Invitation-System&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a template of the Spreadsheet is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtlF0LGs5PVVdFJ3Y19wNnIydnNtb05HSkgzUEFYbGc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The Master List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;A Google Docs Spreadsheet with the list of people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Info&lt;/strong&gt;: Name, Email, Company, Group (invited to all sessions or only reception). [Tip: GAS MailApp allows comma separated emails, so you can send it to the person AND their assistant.]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an identification number used to match each person with their reply. I used this Spreadsheet formula to generate it:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727042
&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A List of the Sessions to place the &lt;em&gt;Confirmed&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Declined&lt;/em&gt;, and their comments (e.g. vegetarian)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I had to add later on few other columns to put things like Badge Name (via a formula), Comments...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-18-at-2-50-43-pm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2406&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2012-05-18 at 2.50.43 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-18-at-2-50-43-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Managing the invitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The main loop is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For every person, send them an email if the have &quot;Go&quot; Status, then set to &quot;Emailed&quot;.  Choose the right template for each group.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If &quot;Emailed&quot;, check for replies and set to &quot;Received&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If &quot;Received&quot; check for new replies. (I ended up removing this to a separate function)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727107
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;To send the invitations, I chose the template depending on the Group, which is then basically a call to &lt;em&gt;MailApp &lt;/em&gt;with a HTML email body hard-coded&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727146
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The interesting bit is the &lt;em&gt;construct_URL &lt;/em&gt;function. We made a reply questionnaire using Google Forms, where we write the rough agenda and we ask if you can join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;We actually made two Google Forms, one for each group with its questions to the appropriate sessions. Instead of just adding the link to the email, &lt;strong&gt;I used the URL to pass along personalized pre-populated information&lt;/strong&gt; to the form. That saves time to the person (we already know his name, and also allows us to place the Token on the last field to identify the answer). [btw Non ASCII characters like accents, can break on IE]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20120518-tuene3ea161sej1p3cbe8i1is3.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2424&quot; title=&quot;20120518-tuene3ea161sej1p3cbe8i1is3&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20120518-tuene3ea161sej1p3cbe8i1is3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;710&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;This is the simple code to make a personalized URL like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHFWZllkZWluU2ZEbFU0X0FZaFZJZHc6MQ&amp;amp;entry_6=Dr.&amp;amp;entry_0=Bruno&amp;amp;entry_7=S%C3%A1nchez-Andrade%20Nu%C3%B1o&amp;amp;entry_8=Global%20Adaptation%20Institute&amp;amp;entry_9=Director%20for%20Science%20and%20Technology&amp;amp;entry_5=t200w167&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727214
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Now the answers are registered in another Google Spreadsheet. To check for those answers, you just need to process that Sheet looking for Tokens to match the reply with the person (they might have changed their name or other info):&lt;/p&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727230
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The actual Processing of the information is then just placing the answers from the response form into the appropriate row in the Master List. You just need to code a single reply and iterate to each. Also the special cases Yes/No to all. Making the loop for all matching Token makes sure that the last Reply is the one remaining, in case they submitted more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The nice thing is that now we can carry back all modifications to their info back to the Master List. If we misspelled their name, or they changed Position, they will likely correct that in the form, and this little code will flag that in green for you. So next time the code uses that information for other emails, badges, or other events, &lt;strong&gt;their information will be updated, by them&lt;/strong&gt; (I found this to be the case in 5% of the cells).&lt;/p&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727260
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;A few days before the event you can send a reminder to those attending to at least one session, with a confirmation of their reply, so they can update it if there has been changes. You can also add some attachments with more info:&lt;/p&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727288
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;[We used a very similar IF condition to print the badges for everyone coming to at least one session]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Media Consent Forms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;We also prepared a document to allow us to take pictures of the participants during the event. Again, I would hate to make them write their name, If I already know it. All we did was upload to Consent document to a Google Docs, and personalize it:&lt;/p&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727302
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, there is not Print option inside GAS, so you need to search on your Google Docs for the common part of the Title of all those consent forms. Then batch download them as a zip file (&quot;Select all&quot; then &quot;Download&quot;). Once in your computer, just drop them to the printer icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Managing the Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Once you have all the Information in the Master List, is quite easy to manage many parts of the event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badges&lt;/strong&gt;: Very similar code to the Consent Forms to print the Names and Companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing the Info&lt;/strong&gt;: The Google Docs should not be shared with anyone, only the people inside your team, and only editable to a few. I was really afraid of changes in the Master List, so used to option to set different access right to individual sheets. You can also use the GAS &lt;em&gt;onOpen &lt;/em&gt;function and &lt;em&gt;SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().addMenu(&quot;Annual Meeting&quot;, menuEntries)&lt;/em&gt; to add an extra menu, only to particular users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;security&quot; src=&quot;https://img.skitch.com/20120518-ejxaiyufmy1gy9yu71mfat1t9t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;805&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with &quot;Manuals&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: There will always be cases when they reply via a phone, or you need to update the reply. Since this system relies upon keywords in the &quot;Status&quot; column you only need to set it to something else than the chosen ones to track manual instances. For example set it to &quot;Manual&quot; and add the &quot;Confirmed&quot; replies on the appropriate Field. You can also put any other Status, and you will be able to track it on the Status Sheet ( i.e. How many &quot;Missing Email&quot; we have?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Tracking Participation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Having all the information in one placed and updated in almost real time, allows to easily track the progress, with only a few Google Spreadsheet Formulas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-18-at-4-26-46-pm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2410&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2012-05-18 at 4.26.46 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-18-at-4-26-46-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;457&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Count number of Confirmation for a particular Session:
=COUNTIF('Master list'!K:K,&quot;Confirmed&quot;)
Count the total number of Replies:
=COUNTIF('Master list'!J:J,&quot;Replied&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;You can even prepare a Participation list for each Session, with Names, Titles, ... Very useful for example to order lunch and spot vegetarians. This is the formula to pull out a sorted list:&lt;/p&gt;
https://gist.github.com/2727461
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Tracking Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;After the event, we can update the actual participation, and send a personalized Thank You note, and include a quick Feedback Questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;It was actually fun to code this system. It is the first time I use GAS, or even code in Javascript, and it turned out to be very fun. The debugging options are very useful, specially since I was developing on-demand, so I made sure to place plenty of stop flags before sending to all our invitees a broken email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The actual managers in charge of organizing this event where very happy and loved the system. I tried to anticipate all their needs and plan a structured clean script. In the end  there was some organic growth to code things or  cases I had not planned, but it turned out to be incremental changes, never too deep. Unfortunately that turned the system highly customized and not re-usable without many modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;I got some actual comments from the end-users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;from a participant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I just wanted to take a moment after the successful annual conference you just organized to briefly mention that the registration system you used excelled any other mechanism I've seen in hundreds of other conferences throughout my professional experience. In your case, we got emails with the right information, including attachments, in a timely manner. I specially appreciated you pre-populated every communication and form with the information I initially gave you. This makes a difference, unlike other systems, where you annoyingly have to enter the same information once and again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;from our staff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Best registration system I've seen. And I've seen many.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With just a few weeks to go before our nonprofit's annual event, we were so lucky to have this system to organize participant information, mail invitations, receive responses and calculate the data in a very organized fashion. The most efficient piece was the opportunity to personalize each email and feedback form on GoogleDocs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Our process was more efficient because of the system Bruno, implemented to help streamline and reduce our workload.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;This system is far from needing an actual developer to nanny its execution, and also far from being re-usable (separating the system and the particularities of our event). Yet, I am proud of it, and how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;What I would do differently in the code if I were to do it again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Email body should not be hard-coded, it should be placed on a separate sheet to be taken from there. Also add a simple text version (reduces spam score).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I would implement a &quot;putRowsData&quot; similar to &quot;getRowsData&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Customize the Forms so they live inside our NGO site, not using the Google Templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;After this expericence I missed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The option in GAS MailApp to authenticate as another user to send on his/her behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The option in GAS MailApp to save the output to the Drafts folder, instead of sending the email directly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;GAS Mailapp will not accept a Google Docs as the body of the email. That would be great!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;A way to sync the code to a revision system. e.g. link it to a git repository or, even better, allow &quot;includes&quot; to pull the code at execution time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;A &quot;sandbox mode&quot; where all output goes to you. E.g. email to be send to user@example.com would actually go to brunosan+user-example-com@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;URL fetch would sometimes silently fail. Better fetch once and re-use if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.&lt;/li&gt;

		<link href="/idea-synthetic-multi-beam-microphone"/>
		<updated>2012-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
		<id>/idea-synthetic-multi-beam-microphone</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/dominicspics/4626277810/sizes/l/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2383&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2012-05-02 at 21.54.28&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-02-at-21-54-28.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Speaker Lattice Array - Brian Eno Speaker Flowers Sound Installation at Marlborough House by Dominic's pics, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/dominicspics/4626277810/&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; This idea is for a synthetic multi-beam microphone, basically allowing to select and amplify sound coming from any, and all, selectable angles and distances, at once, live or replaying the sound, and to detect their LOS velocity. Combined with a speaker, it can be a multi-beam sonar.Physically it would be an array of microphones, at the size of the lattice would define part of the resolution. The rest would come from the software. I thought of this merging concepts of sounds, nets, radioastronomy and optical interferometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Not really sure this make sense, but I post it here in case someone is looking for projects of ideas (#sciencehackday?). That´s why I make these &lt;a href=&quot;http://brunosan.eu/category/idea/&quot;&gt;[Idea] posts&lt;/a&gt; (and to protect them from patents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Antennas tend to be parabolic because they make the waves converge at the same time in one point, hence amplifying the physical signals of the whole area of the antena instead of just hearing those coming to one point. I remember this from high school and then some work I did with light (EM interferometry in radio, IR, visible, UV). The other day I was thinking about the equivalent with pressure waves (sound). I &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/114359371386539617196/posts/ED9NbMYetdb&quot;&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; a quick idea in the back of my mind and then let it mulle for a few days.

&lt;strong&gt;What if you put a flat 2D array of microphones?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;If the sound comes from far away, in front of you&lt;/em&gt;
The pressure waves are flat and arrive to the mics at the same time. You just need to sum up the digital signals from each mic to interferometrically capture the sound from far points. The rest of signals will tend to cancel out. You can even misalign/cover a few of the mics and subtract them from the signal to remove some of the background noise and electronic/thermal pedestal. You won´t really know the distance, but you know the direction and that they are far. &quot;Far&quot; means compared to the distance between mics.

&lt;em&gt;If the sound comes from far away, but on the side (at an angle)&lt;/em&gt;
Same thing as above, but when you are summing up the signals, you introduce the delay, for each mic, corresponding to the travelling time of the waves between the mics. Tuning the delay you can point your beam and listen to a particular direction. The &lt;strong&gt;cool &lt;/strong&gt;thing is that you can do this delays via software, so you can virtually point at&lt;strong&gt; multiple directions at the same time&lt;/strong&gt;. Or even just replaying the data afterwards. They do this in radioastronomy with radio signals.
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/ear-0011.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-2386&quot; title=&quot;ear.001&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/ear-0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If the sounds comes from a close source&lt;/em&gt;
Same thing just tune the offset to each node in the mic array needs to match the propagation of the arrival of the wave. E.g. If it comes from close but straight in front, tune it from the center outwards. Think you are matching the wave as it propagates outwards. Setting those delays, you can tune your ear for a given distance.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/ear-002.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2387&quot; title=&quot;ear.002&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/ear-002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;463&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You could then virtually tune your ear &lt;strong&gt;simultaneously to any and all&lt;/strong&gt; points in the 3D space, live or just re-playing the sounds.

More awesomeness, you can further tune the ear in frequency using digital &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform&quot;&gt;Fourier transforms&lt;/a&gt;. For example the frequency of a car engine, of human voices, ...

&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;angular&lt;/em&gt; resolution of the ear would depend on the distance and angle to the source and the frequency of the sound, and roughly the projected distance between mics and, say, a quarter (peak to valley) of the wavelength in question.

The temporal resolution, for off-axis sources, would be the accuracy by which you can shift the digital signals in time (and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency&quot;&gt;Nyquist frequency&lt;/a&gt; of the sampling).

With light, the speed is so fast (c) that it makes temporal shifts hard and mostly non digital), also the frequency makes the arrays to be huge (radio) or tiny (UV).

Audible sounds waves are 20-20k Hz. Seems a range software could handle well. About the propagation speed (function of density but roughly 300m/s) not sure what implies in terms of the array dimensions... but now that I think of it, I remember geologist use arrays of mics to detect ultrasonic echoes to measure crust and mantle topology... there must a range where all this makes sense and has it s application.

When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/114359371386539617196/posts/ED9NbMYetdb&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; this on Google Plus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/106437074792002603331/posts&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; told me that part of the software can readily available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lofar.ie&quot;&gt;Lofar&lt;/a&gt;. For the hardware part, there seem to be cheap &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brunosan-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;field-keywords=microphone&amp;amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;amp;sprefix=microp%2Caps%2C147#/ref=sr_nr_p_72_0?rh=n:172282,k:microphone,p_72:1248879011&quot;&gt;microphones&lt;/a&gt; to make a DIY lattice.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and what If you introduce a speaker?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Let´s make it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_aperture_sonar&quot;&gt;synthetic sonar&lt;/a&gt;! Imagine you can play a sound for one 1/10 of a second. It would come back if there is something reflecting it 30 meters away. To make sure you can repeat the sound with slightly different frequencies to identify each member of the sequence and sum up the peaks in responses.

Now the same object is moving closer. That means there will be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect&quot;&gt;Doppler effect&lt;/a&gt;. And that make it possible to estimate the LOS velocity.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dopplerfrequenz.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2384&quot; title=&quot;Dopplerfrequenz&quot; src=&quot;http://nasonurb.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dopplerfrequenz.gif?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Since the frequency that you emit will be shifted by Doppler, you need a way to identify each emission so that you don´t need to wait before sending the next probe. That´s a pretty interesting mathematical problem I remember going a to a talk about. I can´t more info, but the key was to modulate the emission in a certain way to that could invert the echo from the known input.

&lt;strong&gt;... and if you put an array of speakers? &lt;/strong&gt;You could concentrate the pressure waves on a particular point. Sounds useful...

Anyway. Here I stop.

		<content type="html">&lt;em&gt;Reblogged from &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/submission/2022621/nasa-chief-scientist-responds-to-ex-employees?utm_source=rss1.0&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;. Emphasis added:&lt;/em&gt;

Last week a fellow at the Heartland Institute, a group &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/02/15/1515208/leaked-heartland-institute-documents-reveal-opposition-to-science&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;now notorious for their plan to subvert public science education&lt;/a&gt;, gathered a coalition of 49 ex-NASA employees to &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.slashdot.org/story/12/04/12/176200/ex-nasa-employees-accuse-agency-of-extreme-position-on-climate-change&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sign a petition&lt;/a&gt; urging NASA to reconsider its position on climate change. For perspective, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/13/nasa-climate-change-denier-stunts_n_1424492.html?ref=mostpopular&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NASA currently employes over 18,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, and there are likely tens of thousands of ex-employees. In their letter the group requested that NASA refrain from publishing unproven remarks. Since no theory can ever be considered proven, this appears to be an attempt to silence discussion. NASA Chief Scientist Waleed Abdalati &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36679&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;has since responded&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Earth science programs provide many unique space-based observations and research capabilities to the scientific community to inform investigations into climate change... After these studies have met the appropriate standards of scientific peer-review, we strongly encourage scientists to communicate these results to the public. &lt;strong&gt;If the authors of this letter disagree with specific scientific conclusions&lt;/strong&gt; made public by NASA scientists,&lt;strong&gt; we encourage them to join the debate in the scientific literature or public forums rather than restrict any discourse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<updated>2012-04-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
		<id>/el-feudo-cubano-2012</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;IMG_6309 by brunosan, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/6914300048/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7247/6914300048_58829fd568.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_6309&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Hace unos días estuve en la Habana, Cuba, con mi padre de vacaciones. Tenía muchas ganas de ir, y aprender. Me preguntaba ¿Qué es lo que opina el cubano de la calle? ¿Qué es el régimen revolucionario, en términos reales? ¿Cómo es el sector privado allí? ¿Qué no se puede hacer? ¿Que beneficios tiene un sistema comunista? ... Esto es lo que he podido medio entender después de una semana de vacaciones allí, charlando con cubanos, viviendo en un apartamento alquilado, yendo a varias ciudades en las afueras (Mariel y Viñales), visitando un hospital, una universidad, un conservatorio, varias casas particulares...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;La Habana es una sociedad rota. Su sistema de valores económicos no tiene sentido, lo que la lleva a un absoluto desastre que se extiende a todas las facetas de la ciudad, o incluso el país. Su sistema educativo aporta una base teórica sin utilidad en el mundo real al que el cubano se enfrenta al terminar. Ni yo le encuentro sentido, ni la mayoría de los cubanos con los que he podido charlar sobre esto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;El punto de inflexión parece ser el &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodo_especial&quot;&gt;periodo especial&lt;/a&gt;&quot; cuando la caída soviética. Cuba vivía en buena parte de sus ayudas y acuerdos. Al terminarse esta vital ayuda la sociedad cubana paso de ser comunista (medianamente funcional y sin incentivo oficial de superación fuera del patriotismo), a &quot;no tener nada que comer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;No tuvo más remedio que abrirse al turismo, lo que introdujo un sistema económico paralelo: el dólar. Años después, se decidió crear una moneda de valor artificial, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_convertible_peso&quot;&gt;el peso convertible&lt;/a&gt;, CUC (apodado en broma &quot;cuenta unificada del comandante&quot;).  Su valor se iguala ficticiamente al dólar, por lo que no tiene ningún respaldo fuera del país. El sistema del dólar, o CUC, es un despropósito que rompe el concepto monetario como herramienta de transacción de valor, y cuyas consecuencias se agravan cada año.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;El sueldo oficial de un médico, ingeniero, profesor, o cualquier otra profesión de alto nivel y preparación, puede estar en torno a los 400-500 pesos nacionales cubanos. Un bollo de pan puede costar 5 pesos cubanos. Montar en bus 10. La electricidad, gas o teléfono de un hogar 300-400 en total. Puesto que tu casa no es de tu propiedad, no hay alquileres ni hipotecas (puedes &quot;permutar&quot; tu casa por otra), pero sí corre de tu cuenta mantener la casa, aunque casi nadie lo haga. La sociedad cubana era consistentemente necesitada, si no pobre. Ahora, por la interacción del CUC, los cubanos dolarizados (o bien por remesas o por contacto con el turista) rompen todos esos esquemas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;IMG_6634 by brunosan, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/6914512326/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7222/6914512326_b727a77184.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_6634&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
1 CUC, o dólar, son unos 20 pesos nacionales. Entonces, 20 dólares es un sueldo mensual en moneda nacional. Aquellos que tengan acceso a remesas o a turistas pueden ganar en un día más que lo que gana un médico en un mes. Taxistas, camareros, guías, gente vendiendo flores en la calle son ejemplos claros, pero también el mendigo o la jinetera están expuestos a un sistema altamente volátil de acceso a mucho dinero. Como no hay incentivo en ahorrar &quot;la gente vive al día: o no tiene, o se lo gasta todo&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;La oferta y la demanda, base de una economía capitalista, se ve introducida por medio del turista que viene a gastar sus dólares en lo que más le apetezca por el mínimo coste. Es  un doble juego con el comunismo completamente incompatible y termina con una sociedad forzada a engañar y robar al estado para poder subsistir y donde el esfuerzo no se recompensa. ¿Para qué trabajar si vendiendo flores o con mi pequeña remesa gano más dinero? El cubano tiene ahora dólares (CUCs), y por tanto el estándar de dólares irrumpe en la oferta. El sistema comunista no debería ajustar el precio para hacer frente a la demanda. Algunos servicios no lo hacen; otros sí. En cualquier caso el dólar afecta a todos: ahora el cubano ha de pagar dólares para ir en taxi, para cenar en cada vez más restaurantes, para tomar café... pero también para el papel higiénico, desodorante, ropa, cerveza o gasolina.  En CUCs, no se acepta el peso nacional. La lista va aumentando cada mes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;El cubano vive al día. Lo llaman &quot;inventar&quot;. Muchos &quot;no trabajan, inventan&quot;: Pequeños encargos, vender cosillas, buscan turistas para venderles puros... Los que trabajan tienen además que inventar un poco para completar el sueldo con el que comer... o &quot;buscan&quot;. &quot;Buscar&quot; es defraudar, robar al estado desde su puesto de trabajo (por ejemplo el autobusero que mete la mano en la caja, el camarero que se lleva comida a casa, o el enrollador de puros que saca unos cuantos para venderlos)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;IMG_6645 by brunosan, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/7060604649/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/7060604649_a5282bd161.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_6645&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
El cubano revolucionario puro cobra en moneda nacional, no defrauda y paga aproximadamente un 50% de impuestos (aunque con otro nombre). Se jubila con unos 30$ al mes, lo que le obliga a &lt;em&gt;inventar&lt;/em&gt; como taxista, vendedor de flores o de libros en la zona turística.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;El cubano remesero es el que recibe dinero, &lt;em&gt;remesas&lt;/em&gt;, del extranjero. Debido a la absoluta disparidad de la moneda nacional y la divisa, tiene comparativamente mucho dinero y comodidades del extranjero sin hacer nada (ropa cara, cenas en restaurantes de dólares, viaja en taxi,...). Me sorprendió sobremanera ver bastantes iPhones en Habana.&lt;/p&gt;


[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; caption=&quot;Hospital&quot;]&lt;a title=&quot;IMG_6511 by brunosan, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/6914429756/&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Hospital&quot; src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7042/6914429756_211bff581e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_6511&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Por mi experiencia, el cubano suele ser de conversación fácil, dispuesto a debatir y argumentar su postura con pasión. &quot;El 70%&quot; se confesará antirevolucionario, que se iría a EEUU si pudiera... lo dice en privado o incluso por la calle (el caso de una señora sexagenaria, aunque ese comentario hizo desaparecer parte de la gente que se había congregado a charlar). Uno de ellos me argumentó de manera bastante convincente que lo que pasa en cuba se parece mucho a un sistema feudal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Estuve paseando por una Universidad técnica. Me sorprendió ver diagramas de electrónica digital (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=circuito+filtro+pasa+banda&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=MpOHT6y5HMaT0QGfys2zCA&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CC0QsAQ&amp;amp;biw=1352&amp;amp;bih=647&quot;&gt;filtros pasa baja&lt;/a&gt; y pasa alta). Cuando charlé con una estudiante me contaba que ella estudiaba economía... &quot;¿Capitalista?&quot; No, marxista. Me encantaría ver sus libros de texto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Su televisión no tiene anuncios, pero si muchos programas documentales sobre ciencia. Muy buenos, por cierto. Una de las tarde pusieron un documental sobre la tabla periódica de una cadena británica y luego un debate sobre planetas extrasolares y vida en otros planetas. Me pregunto cuantas horas de televisión ve un cubano medio, o cuantas televisiones hay. Prefieren mencionar científicos no americanos, pero es imposible no hacerlo. Curiosamente ponen películas y series americanas (incluido &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; o &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt;). Se pueden ver banderas americanas ondear en las series, pero a veces censuran parte de la pantalla (quizás sean los logotipos de las cadenas de donde toman la señal). Retransmiten los Oscars y los Grammies. La narrativa revolucionaria parece dominar las tardes con tertulias y debates claramente anti-imperialistas. Los telediarios son abiertamente subjetivos y su selección internacional es casi exclusiva de Venezuela si son noticias buenas o EEUU/capitalistas si son malas. Hay programas enteros parafraseando las &quot;Reflexiones de Fidel&quot; o debatiendo sobre lo buenas o interesantes que son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;La electricidad (generada quemando petróleo) es muy barata. Los bares y restaurantes en moneda nacional tienen muy poca selección y no parece haber incentivo de vender. &quot;Es lo que hay&quot; te dirá el camarero con resignación. Hay excepciones de restaurantes nacionales muy buenos, pero casi todos están llenos de turistas, por el relativo alto precio. Los restaurantes privados suelen ser pequeños y tener más oferta. Se les suele llamar &quot;Paladar&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paladar&quot;&gt;a raíz de una telenovela popular&lt;/a&gt;, donde la protagonista monta un exitoso restaurante con ese nombre. Se parecen un poco a los guachinches rurales canarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;IMG_6348 by brunosan, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/7060408843/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7241/7060408843_9b38b604e0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_6348&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Para comer, el cubano tiene una cartilla de racionamiento. Cada persona tiene derecho a comprar, por un precio reducido (un tercio del precio nacional normal, más o menos) ciertos productos como un bollo de pan al día, 4 huevos a la semana, ... en ocasiones especiales la lista incluye dietas especiales que te dan derecho a carne (pollo), yoghurt de soja u otras excepciones. En las &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=cartilla+de+racionamiento&amp;amp;w=64887888%40N00&amp;amp;z=m&quot;&gt;fotos&lt;/a&gt; se ven varias  páginas del libreto. Las casillas  de &quot;fiestas&quot; son para artículos de cumpleaños de niños y otras celebraciones, que ya nunca se usan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Uno pensaría que todo el mundo quiere entonces ser taxista, camarero o cualquier otra profesión que tenga acceso al turista y los dólares. La respuesta es que las plazas para hacerlo de forma legal son muy caras, incluso en dólares. &quot;Hay mucha corrupción en la entrega de estos cargos.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;IMG_6245 by brunosan, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/6914242368/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7270/6914242368_3ed591671c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_6245&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
¿Quién es la &quot;clase alta&quot;?, ¿Quién tiene más poder económico? ¿Quién está por encima del cubano típico en la escala social? Me dicen que los más cercanos al Fidel, los músicos, deportistas, y los &quot;HK&quot;. Los HK son las matrículas especiales para los coches de empresas extranjeras. Los cubanos que estas empresas transnacionales contratan tienen acceso a mucho capital, para usarlo como sea menester y asegurar que la empresa va bien. Si uno se fija los coches cubanos buenos, son de turistas (matrícula T) o &quot;HK&quot;s. El resto del parque móvil son trastabillados coches americanos que llenan la ciudad de olor a petróleo y aceite quemado (La ITV &quot;la puedes pasar &amp;lt;&amp;lt;pagando&amp;gt;&amp;gt; unos 40$&quot;) o viejos coches soviéticos mantenidos a base de quitar piezas. Los cinturones de seguridad ni están ni se les espera. En las listas mundiales de capacidad extraordinaria, donde los médicos cubanos son famosos, deberían estar justo debajo los mecánicos cubanos. Harán maravillas, o chapuzas, para que el coche siga funcionando. Por ejemplo, cuando los depósitos de gasolina se rompen acaban poniendo botellas de plástico las cuales sacan y rellenan directamente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Luego están los &quot;cuentapropistas&quot;. Son los que llamaríamos emprendedores legales. Los que deciden montar un pequeño local y ofrecer sus servicios, usualmente a los turistas. Por ejemplo un pequeño &quot;paladar&quot;, como menciono un poco más arriba. Pagan unos impuestos muy altos y existe mucha volatilidad de que las leyes cambien en su detrimento, pero cada vez son más. Son parte de esa reciente transformación cubana para abrir el comunismo. El cubano que me lo explicó estuvo 5 minutos explicando el concepto de beneficio, &quot;parte de lo que ganas es para ti, te quedas dinero legalmente&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Me fascina pensar que hubiera sido de Cuba si no hubiese habido Revolución. Paseando por la Habana uno siente la belleza de una increíblemente avanzada urbe, secuestrada en el tiempo y desgastada por 50 años de descuido. Lo que parece claro es que ahora será muy complicado levantar este feudo. ¿Cómo evitar la efectiva apropiación de los recursos locales cuando empresas internacionales aprovechen las muchas y necesitadas inversiones? ¿ Cómo incentivar y dar confianza a una población acostumbrada a vivir como supervivientes del día a día, del turista,  de &quot;inventar&quot; o &quot;buscar&quot;? ¿Cómo evitar que muchos de ellos emigren a la primera de cambio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Por alguna razón hay una imagen que me quedó muy grabada en la mente. Estaba paseando por el centro de La Habana y vi de reojo un tullido sin piernas pidiendo dinero. Me dio pena pero tampoco pensé mucho en él. Había demasiado ruido, gente ofreciendo &quot;comida, mi amigo&quot;, &quot;puros, my friend&quot;, libros, música tradicional para turistas por todas partes, ... A la vuelta del paseo, 20 minutos después, lo volví y ver en una bocacalle, llorando con los ojos inflamados de dolor, de impotencia. No estaba mirando a la gente, estaba de lado, restregándose los ojos con unas manos tan sucias como necesitadas. Mi cabeza me dice que quizás sea su truco para pedir dinero, que como él hay muchos más, en Cuba y también en Washington o en Gijón. Lo sé, pero me dio muchísima pena. Sentí mucha empatía, y mucha rabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;“La grandeza de una nación y su progreso puede medirse en cómo trata a sus miembros más débiles&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; Mahatma Ghandi&lt;/p&gt;
Cuba es un país precioso, con muchos recursos y bellezas naturales; con gente que va a la escuela, se forma y luego sale a la calle a sobrevivir como puede mientras el país se desmorona a su alrededor y si te encuentras a un turista te puede arreglar la semana. Obviamente hay excepciones muy honrosas.

Soy consciente que uno no puede absorber la compleja realidad de un país como Cuba en una semana, pero al menos me voy con la experiencia de haber intentado salir de la esfera irreal del &quot;turista de mojito y puro&quot; en la Habana Vieja.
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Hice muchas fotos. Hay una selección en &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.502710973413.438.239200025&amp;amp;type=3&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, y en &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasonurb/sets/72157629410743248/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; hay más, en calidad alta, por si alguien las quiere usar para algo:&lt;/p&gt;
