<p><span style="color:#000000;line-height:23px;">Why is international science and technology policy important?</span></p>

<ol>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Science policy</strong> today has profound global implications</em>. Think about Climate Change. Think about disaster risk management, access to clean water. These are all present <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/sciencediplomacy">challenges we face globally</a>. We need to understand the problem. We must assess the implications of our actions and, thus, help create appropriate fact-based policies.</li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Education</strong> is the key for the futur</em>e. Currently more than <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=world+kids">one third</a> of the world are kids. Providing them with the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms.html">most appropriate education</a> is not only our responsibility, but also the foundation for prosperity, stability, equality and development.</li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Technology</strong> is just starting to unleash its possibilities</em>. Affordable interconnectivity is ubiquitous on increasing number of nations. We create,access, share and adapt information as has never been comparable. 5% of the world’s population access Facebook every day, a company that did not exist 6 years ago. Google Maps provides a free map of the whole word, in many cases down to months-old street view images. While there are substantial benefits and <a href="http://brunosan.eu/2010/11/29/user-generated-content-overview-of-policy-needs/">great potential for societal benefit</a>, the extremely fast development has outpaced regulatory policies, <a href="http://brunosan.eu/2010/11/29/user-generated-content-overview-of-policy-needs/">raising concerns</a>. As with any other tool understanding these innovations are the key to leverage the best outcomes.</li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Never before was S&amp;T so relevant to <strong>development</strong></em>. Mobile subscription <a href="http://ict4dblog.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/global-ict-statistics-on-internet-usage-mobile-broadband-1998-2009/">rates</a> in the developing world are rapidly increasing. At the same time remote sensing, communications technologies and GIS allow for the emergence of unprecedented <em>nowcasting</em> technologies.  This has <a href="http://brunosan.eu/2010/10/28/crowdsourcing-development/">already been proved a vital tool</a> for disaster response, human rights monitoring or healthcare support to name a few. As technologies continue to develop, appropriately embracing these innovations becomes not only necessary but also unavoidable.</li>
